```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(VISCtemplates)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
create_visc_project("H:/visc-projects/VDC###Analysis")
```

## Step one: Create project locally

Use `create_visc_project()` to specify where to save your analysis project. 
The function will set up an R project for your analysis that follows VISC's standard directory structure.

The directory name should match the CAVD name with "Analysis" at the end: `VDC###Analysis`. For example: `Gallo477Analysis`. 
Some studies have other names for the trial protocol, but be sure to use the CAVD name.

The `create_visc_project()` function will produce the following structure and templates:
```
[VDCnnn]Analysis
|- .github/
|  +- pull_request_template.md   # template for GitHub PRs
|
|- .gitignore                     # File types that VISC ignores
|- .Rbuildignore                  # Auto-generated for package development (ignore)
|- DESCRIPTION                    # Project metadata and dependencies 
|
|- docs/
|  +- background.Rmd              # Backround section of PT report
|  +- objectives.Rmd              # Objectives section of PT report
|  +- presentations/              # Protocol presentations
|
|- inst/WORDLIST                  # A lists of words that will be ignored during spell check
|
|- man/                           # Documentation of R functions generated by Roxygen
|
|- NAMESPACE                      # Auto-generated for package development tools (ignore)
|
|- R/                             # R functions
|  +- group-colors.R              # Used to assign group colors across projects
|  +- study_schema.R              # Used to generate table with study design
|
|- README.Rmd                     # top-level description of content and guide to users
|
|- .VDCnnnAnalysis.Rproj          # R project file
```

### Step Two: GitHub

Once you've created the project locally, initialize Git and push to github.com/FredHutch:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Make your project a git repo
usethis::use_git()

# Create a remote repo GitHub, push your work, and open the webpage
usethis::use_github(organisation = "FredHutch", private = TRUE, protocol = "https")
# Make sure your repo is private.
```

Note that you must have a [personal access token (PAT)](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html) set up to do this.

You still need to set the permissions to the project to vidd-visc:

* Settings &rarr; Manage access &rarr; Invite teams or people (button) &rarr; vidd-visc (shows up as FredHutch/vidd-visc)

Set up branch protections:

* Settings &rarr; Branches &rarr; Branch protection rule &rarr; Branch name pattern: master (or some other branch you want to protect) &rarr; Require pull request reviews before merging. 

### Step Three: Documentation

Now you can begin editing the documentation. 

1. README.Rmd: Open README template and add things like documentation of SST.
2. docs/: Write the study background, objectives, and other text that is shared across reports.
3. R/: Adapt the R function templates for the study schema and group colors.

### Step Four: Start Analysis Work

The above setup steps are done on the `master` branch. When you're ready to begin work on the analysis, create a branch. 

Then start working from the PT report template. You can use the template from this package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
use_visc_report(
  report_name = "BAMA-PT-Report", # the name of the report file
  path = "BAMA", # the path within the active directory, usually the name of the assay
  report_type = "bama" # "empty", "generic", or "bama" 
)
```

See the "Using a VISC Report Template" vignette for more details on how to use a report template.

```{r}
vignette("using_pdf_and_word_template")
```


## Spell Check

When the template is generated, it creates a list of custom words that are frequently ignored in VISC reports. This is saved in `inst/WORDLIST`. You can check spelling of files and update `WORDLIST` using the [`spelling` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/spelling/). The `spelling` package only spell checks text blocks, not code chunks.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spelling")

library(spelling)

spell_check_files("BAMA/pt_report/BAMA_pt_report.Rmd")

spell_check_files("BAMA/pt_report/BAMA_pt_report.pdf") # this is helpful for spell checking captions
```
