# Statistical Methods

## Graphical analysis
Distributions of response magnitudes were plotted for each time point and antigen with box plots superimposed on the distributions. The mid-line of the box denoted the median and the ends of the box denote the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denoted the most extreme data points that are no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box).
