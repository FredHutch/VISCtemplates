# Biological Endpoints

ADCC-mediated antibody responses were measured using GranToxiLux (GTL) ADCC assays from specimens obtained at [insert visit, e.g., weeks 0 (before boost), 2 (2 weeks post-boost), 12 (12 weeks post-boost), and 24 (24 weeks post-boost)]. [#] antigens ([insert antigens]) were tested in the GTL assay. The first [#] antigens tested were vaccine-matched and the [#] antigens was tested to evaluate heterologous Clade C responses. The GTL ADCC assay measures percent Granzyme B activity, defined as the percentage of antigen-coated target cells positive for proteolytically active Granzyme B out of the total viable target cell population.
