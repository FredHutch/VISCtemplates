# Statistical Methods

## Graphical analysis

Response rates were plotted for each antigen at each time point. Response rates were also plotted on radar plots, which depicted the response rate for each antigen as a point on an individual spoke. 

Distributions of peak and AUTC across time were plotted for each antigen with box plots superimposed on the distribution of responders. The mid-line of the box denoted the median and the ends of the box denoted the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denoted the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). Lines connected each participant at each time point.

Individual sample-specific magnitude-breadth (MB) curve curves were plotted where the x-axis represented a response magnitude value (x) and the y-axis represented the fraction of antigens or isolates with response magnitudes less than x. In addition to the individual sample-specific curves, the group-specific curve displayed the average MB across all subjects in that group. 

Distributions of durability (area under the durability curve) were plotted with superimposed box plots. The mid-line of the box denoted the median and the ends of the box denoted the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denoted the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box).


## Statistical tests

Response rates were calculated with Wilson's confidence intervals. Response magnitudes were summarized with median, minimum, and maximum. Durability, as defined by change in response magnitude, was measured using area under the AUTC curve from peak to the final durability time point ([insert final time point, e.g., week 24]).
