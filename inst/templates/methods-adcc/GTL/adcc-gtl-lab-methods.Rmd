# Lab Methods
ADCC-mediated antibody responses were measured by ADCC GranToxiLux (GTL) [@Pollara2011] and tested against [insert antigens]. Participant sera were incubated with effector cells and gp120-coated target cells and ADCC was quantified as net percent granzyme B activity, which was the percent of target cells positive for GranToxiLux (GTL) detected by flow cytometry. For each subject at each timepoint, percent granzyme B activity was measured at [#] dilution levels: [insert dilution levels] for each antigen.
