# Biological endpoints

ADCC-mediated antibody responses were measured using the ADCC luciferase assay from serum specimens obtained at weeks [insert timepoint] corresponding to [insert timepoint] weeks after the late-boost vaccination.

The ADCC luciferase assay tests the reactivity of antibodies induced from the participant's serum against Infectious Molecular Clone (IMC)-infected target cells ([insert IMCs]) by measuring percent reduction in Relative 
Luminescence Units (RLUs) over a series of dilutions of the serum.
