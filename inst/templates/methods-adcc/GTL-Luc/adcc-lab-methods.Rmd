# Lab Methods GTL

note to self: decided to pull over the lab methods from HVTN word for word

<!-- ORIGINAL: ADCC-mediated antibody GTL responses were measured by ADCC GranToxiLux (GTL) [@Pollara2011] and tested against [insert antigens]. Participant sera were incubated with effector cells and gp120-coated target cells and ADCC was quantified as net percent granzyme B activity, which was the percent of target cells positive for GranToxiLux (GTL) detected by flow cytometry. For each subject at each timepoint, percent granzyme B activity was measured at [#] dilution levels: [insert dilution levels] for each antigen.  -->

# Lab Methods Luciferase

CEM.NKR~CCR5~ cells [@trkola1999cell] were used as targets for ADCC luciferase assays after infection with the infectious molecular clones ([insert IMCs]). 

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from a HIV-seronegative donor by leukapheresis and cryopreserved until the day of the assay. After thawing and overnight resting in RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics, $10\%$ fetal bovine serum (R10), and 10 ng/mL of IL-15, the PBMCs were used as effector cells at an effector-to-target ratio of 30:1. 

Target and effector cells were plated in white 96-well half-area plates and co-cultured with 4-fold [Adjust if different] serial dilutions of trial participant serum starting at the 1:50 dilution. For each sample, percent specific killing was measured in duplicate at dilutions of 1:50, 1:200, 1:800, 1:3200, 1:12800, and 1:51200 [Adjust if dilutions are different]. Co-cultures were incubated for 6 hours at $37 ^{\circ} C$ in $5\% \text{ CO}_2$. The final readout was the reduction of luminescence intensity generated by the presence of residual intact target cells that had not been lysed by the effector population in the presence of ADCC-mediating serum antibodies. The percentage of killing was calculated using the formula: percent specific loss Luciferase activity = 100 * (RLU of target and effector wellâ€“ RLU of test well)/(RLU of target and effector well).

In this analysis, the Relative Luminescence Units (RLU) of the target plus effector wells represents spontaneous lysis in the absense of any source of antibody and is used to calculate background activity. The monoclonal antibody [insert antibody name from lab study plan] and a cocktail of HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies [insert antibody names from lab study plan, e.g. (A32, 2G12, CH44, and 7B2)] were used as negative and positive controls, respectively.
