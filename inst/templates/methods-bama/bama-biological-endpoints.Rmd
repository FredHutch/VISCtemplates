Serum [IgG/IgA] responses were measured against 
[# antigens; list antigens] 
using the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA). 
Antibody levels were measured as median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from two 
wells and then averaged using the mean. 
Background adjustment was applied using MFI measured from wells with beads that 
include buffer instead of sample. 
Additionally, a blank or reference bead was included to estimate non-specific 
antibody binding. 
Results were obtained for 
[a single dilution at 1:80 for animal data, 1:50 for human data; can vary]. 
Samples with blank MFI > 5000 were excluded from the analysis.

<!-- Either in an antigen summary table or in the biological endpoints section, include information on antigen clade, any relevant panel information (e.g., antigen reagent project [ARP], see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29386288/), sample size by antigen, and whether a blank or a reference bead was used. -->
