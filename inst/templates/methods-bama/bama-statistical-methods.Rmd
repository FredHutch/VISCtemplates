## Statistical Endpoints

### Definition of a Positive Response

Positive responses were defined based on background-adjusted MFI values 
at the screening dilution level. 
Antigen-specific positivity thresholds were computed as the 95th percentile 
of the baseline background-adjusted MFI minus background-adjusted blank (baseline net MFI) 
by antigen. 
Samples from post-enrollment visits were declared to have a positive binding 
antibody response by BAMA if they met three criteria:

* Net MFI values at the screening dilution were greater than the maximum of 100 or 
the 95th percentile of baseline samples (by antigen).
* Net MFI values were greater than three times the baseline background-adjusted MFI 
minus baseline background-adjusted blank values.
* Background-adjusted MFI values were greater than three times the baseline 
background-adjusted MFI values.

Samples were excluded if the blank MFI for the corresponding negative control 
was greater than 5,000. 
Records were excluded at all visits if any of the following occurred at baseline:

* Missing values for MFI, blank MFI, or net MFI
* High background, i.e., blank MFI for negative control > 5,000
* High baseline MFI or net MFI > 6,500

<!-- Either in an antigen summary table or in this section, include information on antigen-specific positivity thresholds. -->

### Response Magnitude

#### MFI*

Log$_{10}$ background- and blank-subtracted MFI (net MFI) was used to evaluate
response magnitudes for each antigen and group. 
Values less than 1 were truncated at 1 before the log transformation was applied. 
Response magnitudes above 22,000 were considered saturated and were truncated 
at 22,000 for statistical analysis.

#### Durability

<!-- if you have durability time points -->

To measure durability, the fold-change in response magnitude [net MFI or AUTC] 
between [week xx] (peak time point) and [week yy] (durability time point) 
was calculated. 
The fold-change was only calculated for antigens with data at both time points 
and for animals/participants with positive responses at peak, 
defined as: 
$\mathrm{log}{10}\text{(fold-change)} = \mathrm{log}{10}\mathrm{(X}{durability}{)} - \mathrm{log}{10}\mathrm{(X}{peak}{)}$, 
where X represents the response magnitude described above. 
For non-responders at durability with response magnitudes below the linear range 
of the assay (MFI* < 100), the value was set to $X{\text{durability}} = 100$ 
for plots and tables.

<!--if you have multiple durability time points--> 

Durability was also measured using area under the durability curve, 
starting with peak (week [xx]). 
Area under the curve (AUC) was estimated by animal/participant on the log$_{10}$ 
scale using the trapezoidal method. 
Net MFI values were truncated at 1 for AUC calculations.

#### AUC-MB

<!-- if you have all antigens from an ARP (antigen reagent project) panel -->

Individual-specific and group-averaged magnitude-breadth (MB) curves (@Huang2009-ao) 
characterized the 
magnitude (binding antibody MFI\*) and 
breadth (number of antigens with positive response at a given value of MFI* that is greater than 100) 
of each individual plasma sample assayed against a panel of antigens. 
These curves were used to display the breadth of binding antibody activity in 
terms of the percentage of antigens with 
log$_{10}$ MFI* $>$ x for the range of $\mathrm{MFI}^{*}$ values, x. 
The antigen-specific net MFI value of each non-responder was set to 100.

The area under the MB curve (AUC-MB) was used to summarize the magnitude and 
breadth for each individual at a given time point across a set of antigens. 
$\mathrm{MFI}^{*}$ values were truncated at 100. 
The AUC-MB was calculated as the area under the MB-curves over the entire range 
without truncation, which is equivalent to the average of the log$_{10}$ MFI* 
over the panel of antigens.

## Graphical Analysis

Response rates were plotted, with accompanying Wilson score confidence intervals, 
for each experimental group, time point, and antigen.

Graphical distributions of response magnitudes [net MFI, AUTC, AUC-MB, etc] were 
plotted for each group and time point with box plots superimposed on the 
distribution of positive responders. The mid-line of the box denotes the median 
and the ends of the box denote the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. 
The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 
times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). 
The magnitudes were plotted on a log$_{10}$ scale. AUTC and net MFI lower than 100 
were truncated to 100.

Distributions of durability (log$_{10}$ fold-change in response magnitude/durability AUC) 
were plotted for each group with superimposed box plots. 
Positive responders at [week xx] (peak) were included in the plot. 
The mid-line of the box denotes the median and the ends of the box denote the 
$25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. 
The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 
times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). 
Response proportions were displayed for each group at week [xx, peak].

Individual-specific and group-average magnitude-breadth (MB) curves were plotted 
to display the breadth of binding antibody activities. 
[if applicable] MB curves were stratified by ARP panels (i.e., gp140, gp120 and V1V2) 
(Table `r VISCtemplates::insert_ref("tab:sample-size")`).

Line plots were used to display the trend and the variability of the group
median net MFI or AUTC over time by antigen. 
Net MFI and AUTC values less than 100 were truncated at 100 for plotting purposes. 
Line plots were only displayed for antigens with at least one positive response 
at any time point.

## Statistical Tests

To assess if the treatment groups had different response rates than control, 
each group was compared to control using Barnard’s exact test (two-sided, alpha = 0.05) 
for each isotype and antigen (@Suissa1985 and @Lyderson2009). 
If there were any significant differences from control, 
pairwise treatment group tests were performed using Barnard’s exact test 
(two-sided, alpha = 0.05).

Pairwise comparisons of response magnitude ([AUTC, MFI*]) between study groups 
were performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided, alpha = 0.05) on 
positive responders only. Tests between study groups required at least [three] 
positive responders in each treatment group.

Pairwise comparisons of MFI* durability (fold-change) between peak and 
durability were performed between treatment groups using the log-rank test 
(two-sided, alpha = 0.05) with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney scores and interval 
censoring for each antigen (@Fay2012). 
The method outlined by @Fay2012 maintains the type I error rate under 
assessment-treatment dependence. 
A fold-change was considered censored when the MFI* value at the durability 
time point was below the linear range of the assay. 
For censored values, the lower bound of the interval was set to 
$\mathrm{log_{10}}$$\mathrm{(1/X_{\text{week [peak]}})}$ and 
the upper bound of the interval was set to 
$\mathrm{log_{10}}$$\mathrm{(100/X_{\text{week [peak]}})}$, 
where X represents MFI*, and 100 is the value of the lower bound of the linear 
range of the assay. 
Tests were only performed for pairs of groups where both groups had at least 3 
positive responders at peak, and the median fold-change for at least one group 
was observed (i.e., there were at least as many uncensored values as censored 
values for at least one group).

<!-- if you have multiple durability time points --> 
Comparisons of durability AUC (area under the response magnitude curve from 
peak, week [xx], through week [durability time point]) were made between
vaccine groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (two-sided, alpha = 0.05). 
Durability AUC tests included responders and non-responders 
(with truncated MFI* measurements).

Corrections for multiple testing were not done for this analysis. 
<!-- If there were p-value adjustments, specify the method (i.e. FDR) and what grouping variables the adjustment will be made over (i.e. adjusting over antigens) -->
