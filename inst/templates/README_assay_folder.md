## Overview of {{ study_name}} {{ assay_name }} Reports

<!-- Use a permanent link (with git tag or hash) to link to any data specs and 
     to the version of the report sent to the VDC. -->

<!-- Consider using a tag instead of just the hash to make it easier to compare report versions.
     Tags are also more meaningful and human-readable. -->

       - Navigate to the file on GitHub
       - Click the history button
       - Click the commit corresponding to the distributed report
       - Find the report among the edits and click "View"
       - The hash is url: https://github.com/fredhutch/.../blob/hash/... -->
