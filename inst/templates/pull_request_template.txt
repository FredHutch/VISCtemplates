## Analysis Code Checklist

- [ ] Knit .Rmd yourself to see if everything runs correctly.
- [ ] Check joins and filtering of data.
- [ ] Code is readable, easy to understand, and well-documented.
- [ ] Code follows the style guide.
- [ ] Code follows the functional code guide.
- [ ] Code follows what is written in the statistical methods section.
- [ ] You could own (e.g., explain and reproduce) this code if you had to.


## Writing Review Checklist

- [ ] Does everything look right in the reproducibility tables?
- [ ] Are the tables sorted to present the results in parallel with the Results Section?
- [ ] Double-check significance highlighting.
- [ ] Do footnotes, captions, x- and y- axes, and data in the plot all match / make sense?
- [ ] Plots: do you have at least 2 y-axis tick marks? Do your tick marks cover the minimum and maximum values displayed?
- [ ] Do your captions match the figure and table results?
- [ ] Is the sample type accurate (e.g., serum, plasma, PBMC)? If unsure, confirm with Michelle/Eva.
- [ ] Any broken references (?? or ???) in text (Use find: “??”)?
- [ ] Are the references to figures and tables correct? Do they support what is written in the text?
- [ ] Did you spell-check the text (Hotkey: F7 or `spelling` package)?
- [ ] Did you check that the spelling in all the captions and footnotes (RStudio spellcheck will not check these)?
- [ ] Past tense consistently throughout (Use Find: “are”)
- [ ] Do significant p-values match what results you’re seeing in the plot?
- [ ] Once completed have you committed and pushed all relevant files for the report (i.e. bib file, …)? Can someone else compile this if they cloned the repo?
- [ ] If any iterative changes were made to plots/figures/included data/grammar, search relevant terms in the text to make sure changes were reflected throughout the report.
- [ ] Post revisions: have you updated your captions?
- [ ] Use git diff on the .tex file to confirm differences between original and new revision.
