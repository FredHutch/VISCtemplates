## Statistical Endpoints

Describe the statistical measures of interest (response, response magnitude, etc.) 
including response call methodology and truncation, if applicable.

## Graphical Analysis

Update the following section as appropriate for your data. 

Response rates were plotted, with accompanying Wilson score confidence intervals, 
for each group, antigen, and study time point. 
Distributions of response magnitude were plotted on the log scale for each 
group, antigen, and study time point with box plots superimposed on the 
distribution of responders. 
The mid-line of the box denotes the median and the ends of the box denote 
the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. 
The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 
times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). 
To show response trend over time, line plots of response magnitude were plotted 
on the log scale by study group and antigen across time points.

## Statistical Tests

Update the following section as appropriate for your data. If available, use 
language from the statistical analysis plan. Ensure that this section includes 
all statistical methodology used in the report.

To assess if two groups have different response rates, pairwise group 
comparisons were conducted using Fisherâ€™s exact test for each time point and 
antigen. 

For comparisons across time, McNemar's test were used to account for paired data. 
Response magnitude comparisons between experimental groups were compared using 
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test [among responders only]. 
Response magnitude comparisons between time points were performed using the 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to account for paired data.
