Neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 pseudoviruses were measured as a function 
of reduction in Tat-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter gene expression in 
TZM-bl cells [@Montefiori2009; @Sarzotti-Kelsoe2014].
Neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution at which relative 
luminescence units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% (ID~50~) relative to the RLUs in 
virus control wells (cell + virus only) after subtraction of background RLUs 
(wells with cells only). 
The assay performed in TZM-bl cells measured neutralization titers against a 
panel of <!--- autologous and ---> heterologous Env-pseudotyped viruses.
[x] pseudoviruses were tested, consisting of [fill in virus, clade, tier],

as well as the global pseudovirus panel and a negative control (SVA-MLV)
[@deCamp2014]. 

<!-- Consider adding a table to list pseudovirus tier, subtype, 
vaccine strain (yes/no), and isolate name (e.g., MW965.26) -->
