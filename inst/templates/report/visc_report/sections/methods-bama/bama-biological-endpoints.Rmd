Serum [IgG/IgA] responses were measured against 
[# antigens; list antigens or reference antigen summary table at end of sentence]
using the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA). 
Antibody levels were measured as median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from two 
wells and then averaged using the mean. 
Background adjustment was applied using MFI measured from wells with beads that 
include buffer instead of sample. 
Additionally, a blank or reference bead was included to estimate non-specific 
antibody binding. 
Results were obtained for 
[a single dilution at 1:80 for animal data, 1:50 for human data; can vary]. 

<!-- For differential binding antigens only -->

The set includes antigens which highlight regions of differential binding to 
[insert target, e.g., the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 envelope]. 
The differential binding set is comprised of [#] experimental 
[if applicable, (including the vaccine-matched antigen [insert vaccine-matched antigen])] and 
[#] matched reference antigens, where the reference antigens lack accessible 
target binding sites (knockout sites) present in the experimental antigens [reference tables]. 
[If applicable] An abbreviated name is used to simplify figures and tables 
included in this report and is proposed for each antigen [reference table].

<!-- Either in an antigen summary table or in the biological endpoints section, 
include information on antigen clade, any relevant panel information 
(e.g., antigen reagent project [ARP], see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29386288/),
sample size by antigen, positivity threshold, and whether a blank or a reference 
bead was used. For differential binding antigens, include a table of the 
experimental and paired reference antigens, abbreviated antigen names if used, 
and the target site for antibody binding. -->
