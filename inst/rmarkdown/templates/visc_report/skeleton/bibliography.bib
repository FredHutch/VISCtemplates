	abstract = {Immunogenic regions of the gp41 transmembrane protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were previously mapped by examining polyclonal sera from HIV-infected patients and rodent polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to peptides of gp41. To define the epitopes within these regions to which infected humans respond during the course of infection, the specificity of human MAbs to these regions had to be studied. Using 10 human MAbs identified initially by their reactivity to whole gp41 in HIV-1 lysates, the epitopes within the immunodominant region of gp41 and within a second immunogenic region of gp41 have been mapped. Thus, five MAbs (from five different patients) to the immunodominant domain of gp41 in the vicinity of the cysteines at positions 598 and 604 (hereinafter designated cluster I) reacted with a stretch of 11 amino acids from positions 590 to 600. Four of these five MAbs were reactive with linear epitopes, while one MAb required the conformation conferred by the disulfide bridge between the aforementioned cysteines. Three MAbs to cluster I revealed dissociation constants ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-8) M, depending on the MAb tested and the size of the synthetic or recombinant peptide used in the assay. Five additional MAbs reacted with a second immunogenic region between positions 644 and 663 (designated cluster II). Four of these five MAbs were specific for conformational determinants. Titration of sera from HIV-infected patients showed that there was about 100-fold more antibody to cluster I than to cluster II in patients' sera, confirming the immunodominance of cluster I.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of the transmitted virus and sequences evolving from it could be instrumental in elucidating the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and in developing vaccines, drugs, or microbicides to prevent infection. Here we describe an experimental approach to analyze HIV-1 env genes as intact genetic units amplified from plasma virion RNA by single-genome amplification (SGA), followed by direct sequencing of uncloned DNA amplicons. We show that this strategy precludes in vitro artifacts caused by Taq-induced nucleotide substitutions and template switching, provides an accurate representation of the env quasispecies in vivo, and has an overall error rate (including nucleotide misincorporation, insertion, and deletion) of less than 8 × 10−5. Applying this method to the analysis of virus in plasma from 12 Zambian subjects from whom samples were obtained within 3 months of seroconversion, we show that transmitted or early founder viruses can be identified and that molecular pathways and rates of early env diversification can be defined. Specifically, we show that 8 of the 12 subjects were each infected by a single virus, while 4 others acquired more than one virus; that the rate of virus evolution in one subject during an 80-day period spanning seroconversion was 1.7 × 10−5 substitutions per site per day; and that evidence of strong immunologic selection can be seen in Env and overlapping Rev sequences based on nonrandom accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations. We also compared the results of the SGA approach with those of more-conventional bulk PCR amplification methods performed on the same patient samples and found that the latter is associated with excessive rates of Taq-induced recombination, nucleotide misincorporation, template resampling, and cloning bias. These findings indicate that HIV-1 env genes, other viral genes, and even full-length viral genomes responsible for productive clinical infection can be identified by SGA analysis of plasma virus sampled at intervals typical in large-scale vaccine trials and that pathways of viral diversification and immune escape can be determined accurately.},

Data are usually obtained by measurements on samples in microwell plates and are often subjected to artefacts that can bias the result selection. We report here a novel edge effect correction algorithm suitable for RNA interference (RNAi) screening, because its normalization does not rely on the entire dataset and takes into account the specificities of such a screening process. The proposed method is able to estimate the edge effects for each assay plate individually using the data from a single control column based on diffusion model, and thus targeting a specific but recurrent well-known HTS artefact. This method was first developed and validated using control plates and was then applied to the correction of experimental data generated during a genome-wide siRNA screen aimed at studying HIV–host interactions. The proposed algorithm was able to correct the edge effect biasing the control data and thus improve assay quality and, consequently, the hit-selection step.

	doi = {10.1128/JVI.06594-11},
	abstract = {The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) exerts a multifaceted antiviral effect against HIV-1 infection. First, A3G was shown to be able to terminate HIV infection by deaminating the cytosine residues to uracil in the minus strand of the viral DNA during reverse transcription. Also, a number of studies have indicated that A3G inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcription by a non-editing-mediated mechanism. However, the mechanism by which A3G directly disrupts HIV-1 reverse transcription is not fully understood. In the present study, by using a cell-based coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, we detected the direct interaction between A3G and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in produced viruses and in the cotransfected cells. The data also suggested that their interaction did not require viral genomic RNA bridging or other viral proteins. Additionally, a deletion analysis showed that the RT-binding region in A3G was located between amino acids 65 and 132. Overexpression of the RT-binding polypeptide A3G(65-132) was able to disrupt the interaction between wild-type A3G and RT, which consequently attenuated the anti-HIV effect of A3G on reverse transcription. Overall, this paper provides evidence for the physical and functional interaction between A3G and HIV-1 RT and demonstrates that this interaction plays an important role in the action of A3G against HIV-1 reverse transcription.},

	abstract = {HIV-1 and its simian counterpart SIV have been exquisitely tailored by evolution to evade host immunity. By virtue of specific adaptations that thwart individual innate or adaptive immune mechanisms, and an overall replication strategy that provides for rapid establishment of a large, systemic viral population, capable of dynamic adaptation to almost all immune selection pressures, these viruses, once established, almost invariably stay one step ahead of the host, and in the vast majority of infected individuals, replicate indefinitely. Although many of vaccine approaches tested to date have been able to enhance the magnitude of the immune responses to HIV/SIV infection, most of these responses, whether cellular or humoral in nature, have largely failed to be both effectively anti-viral and targeted such that fully functional escape variants are not easily selected. Recent advances, however, have provided strong evidence that the initial stages of infection following mucosal transmission of these viruses are more vulnerable to immune intervention, and have led to the development of vaccine strategies that elicit responses able to effectively intervene in these early stages of infection, either preventing acquisition of infection or by establishing early, stringent, and durable control. Here, we place HIV/AIDS vaccine development in the context of the basic immunobiology of HIV/SIV, review the evidence for the vulnerability of early infection to immunity, and discuss how these newly recognized immune vulnerabilities might be exploited for the development of an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine.},

The active site region is identified by the position of two of the conserved carboxylate residues essential for catalysis, which are located at similar positions in ribonuclease H.

	abstract = {Summary
HIV latency is the chief obstacle to eradicating HIV but is widely believed to be an evolutionary accident providing no lentiviral fitness advantage. However, findings of latency being “hardwired” into HIV’s gene-regulatory circuitry appear inconsistent with latency being an evolutionary accident, given HIV’s rapid mutation rate. Here, we propose that latency is an evolutionary “bet-hedging” strategy whose frequency has been optimized to maximize lentiviral transmission by reducing viral extinction during mucosal infections. The model quantitatively fits the available patient data, matches observations of high-frequency latency establishment in cell culture and primates, and generates two counterintuitive but testable predictions. The first prediction is that conventional CD8-depletion experiments in SIV-infected macaques increase latent cells more than viremia. The second prediction is that strains engineered to have higher replicative fitness—via reduced latency—will exhibit lower infectivity in animal-model mucosal inoculations. Therapeutically, the theory predicts treatment approaches that may substantially enhance “activate-and-kill” HIV-cure strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

A vaccine is needed to prevent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.


METHODS

A double-blind, randomized trial of a recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein subunit (rgp120) vaccine was conducted among men who have sex with men and among women at high risk for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1. Volunteers received 7 injections of either vaccine or placebo (ratio, 2 : 1) over 30 months. The primary end point was HIV-1 seroconversion over 36 months.


RESULTS

A total of 5403 volunteers (5095 men and 308 women) were evaluated. The vaccine did not prevent HIV-1 acquisition: infection rates were 6.7\% in 3598 vaccinees and 7.0\% in 1805 placebo recipients; vaccine efficacy (VE) was estimated as 6\% (95\% confidence interval, -17\% to 24\%). There were no significant differences in viral loads, rates of antiretroviral-therapy initiation, or the genetic characteristics of the infecting HIV-1 strains between treatment arms. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed nonsignificant trends toward efficacy in preventing infection in the highest risk (VE, 43\%; n=247) and nonwhite (VE, 47\%; n=914) volunteers (P=.10, adjusted for multiple subgroup comparisons).


CONCLUSIONS

There was no overall protective effect. The efficacy trends in subgroups may provide clues for the development of effective immunization approaches.},

Antibodies of the VRC01 class neutralize HIV-1, arise in diverse HIV-1-infected donors, and are potential templates for an effective HIV-1 vaccine. However, the stochastic processes that generate repertoires in each individual of \&gt;1012 antibodies make elicitation of specific antibodies uncertain. Here we determine the ontogeny of the VRC01 class by crystallography and next-generation sequencing. Despite antibody-sequence differences exceeding 50\%, antibody-gp120 cocrystal structures reveal VRC01-class recognition to be remarkably similar. B cell transcripts indicate that VRC01-class antibodies require few specific genetic elements, suggesting that naive-B cells with VRC01-class features are generated regularly by recombination. Virtually all of these fail to mature, however, with only a few—likely one—ancestor B cell expanding to form a VRC01-class lineage in each donor. Developmental similarities in multiple donors thus reveal the generation of VRC01-class antibodies to be reproducible in principle, thereby providing a framework for attempts to elicit similar antibodies in the general population.},

Immunofluorescence analysis of env-transduced cells demonstrates expression of the protein at the cell surface, and we show that the protein confers infectivity to simian immunodeficiency virus pseudotypes. Western blot analysis of the pseudotyped virions further discloses the expected specific cleavage of the ENV precursor protein. This functional ENV could play a role in the amplification—via infection of the germ line—of the HERV-K genomic copies, all the more as coding HERV-K gag and pol genes can similarly be found in the human genome, which could therefore generate infectious virions of a fully endogenous origin.},

Here we present structural analyses of two rabbit MAbs, R56 and R20, against the third variable region (V3) of HIV-1 gp120. R56 recognizes the well-studied immunogenic region in the V3 crown, while R20 targets a less-studied region at the C terminus of V3. By comparison of the Fab/epitope complex structures of these two antibodies raised by immunization with that of the corresponding human antibodies derived from patients chronically infected with HIV-1, we found that rabbit antibodies can recognize immunogenic regions of gp120 and mimic the binding modes of human antibodies. This result can provide new insight into the use of the rabbit as an animal model in AIDS vaccine development.},

Twenty HIV-1 Env glycoproteins were examined for their ability to bind human anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and then used as immunogens in guinea pigs to identify promising immunogens. These included five Envs derived from chronically infected individuals, each representing one of five common clades and eight consensus Envs based on these five clades, as well as the consensus of the entire HIV-1 M group, and seven transmitted/founder (T/F) Envs from clades B and C. Sera from immunized guinea pigs were tested for neutralizing activity using 36 HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped viruses. All Envs bound to CD4 binding site, membrane-proximal, and V1/V2 MAbs with similar apparent affinities, although the T/F Envs bound with higher affinity to the MAb 17b, a CCR5 coreceptor binding site antibody. However, the various Envs differed in their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. Consensus Envs elicited the most potent responses, but neutralized only a subset of viruses, including mostly easy-to-neutralize tier 1 and some more-difficult-to-neutralize tier 2 viruses. T/F Envs elicited fewer potent neutralizing antibodies but exhibited greater breadth than chronic or consensus Envs. Finally, chronic Envs elicited the lowest level and most limited breadth of neutralizing antibodies overall. Thus, each group of Env immunogens elicited a different antibody response profile. The complementary benefits of consensus and T/F Env immunogens raise the possibility that vaccines utilizing a combination of consensus and T/F Envs may be able to induce neutralizing responses with greater breadth and potency than single Env immunogens.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

While chronically infected individuals harbor a genetically diverse set of viruses, most new infections are established by single variants, termed transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses. This raises the question whether certain viral variants have particular properties allowing them to more efficiently overcome the transmission bottleneck. Preferential binding of the viral envelope (Env) to the integrin α4β7 has been hypothesized as one important feature of transmitted viruses. Here, we compared Envs from subtype C viruses that were transmitted to those that were prevalent in chronic infections for efficiency in utilizing α4β7, CD4 and CCR5 for cell entry and replication. We found that transmitted and chronic Envs engaged CD4 and CCR5 with equal efficiency, and that blocking the interaction between Env and α4β7 failed to inhibit replication of T/F as well as control viruses. While the search for determinants of transmission fitness remains an important goal, preferential CD4, CCR5 or α4β7 interactions do not appear to represent distinguishing features of T/F viruses.},

In contrast to previously characterized glycan-dependent bNAbs that recognize high-mannose N-glycans, PGT121 binds complex-type N-glycans in glycan microarrays. We isolated the B-cell clone encoding PGT121, which segregates into PGT121-like and 10-1074-like groups distinguished by sequence, binding affinity, carbohydrate recognition, and neutralizing activity. Group 10-1074 exhibits remarkable potency and breadth but no detectable binding to protein-free glycans. Crystal structures of unliganded PGT121, 10-1074, and their likely germ-line precursor reveal that differential carbohydrate recognition maps to a cleft between complementarity determining region (CDR)H2 and CDRH3. This cleft was occupied by a complex-type N-glycan in a "liganded" PGT121 structure. Swapping glycan contact residues between PGT121 and 10-1074 confirmed their importance for neutralization. Although PGT121 binds complex-type N-glycans, PGT121 recognized high-mannose-only HIV envelopes in isolation and on virions. As HIV envelopes exhibit varying proportions of high-mannose- and complex-type N-glycans, these results suggest promiscuous carbohydrate interactions, an advantageous adaptation ensuring neutralization of all viruses within a given strain.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive assessments of immune correlates of protection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine trials are essential to vaccine design. Neutralization sieve analysis compares the neutralization sensitivity of the breakthrough transmitted/founder (TF) viruses from vaccinated and control animals to infer the molecular mechanisms of vaccine protection. Here, we report a robust neutralization sieve effect in a nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine trial (DNA prime/recombinant adenovirus type 5 [rAd5] boost) (VRC-10-332) that demonstrated substantial protective efficacy and revealed a genetic signature of neutralization resistance in the C1 region of env. We found significant enrichment for neutralization resistance in the vaccine compared to control breakthrough TF viruses when tested with plasma from vaccinated study animals, plasma from chronically SIV-infected animals, and a panel of SIV-specific monoclonal antibodies targeting six discrete Env epitopes (P {\textless} 0.008 for all comparisons). Neutralization resistance was significantly associated with the previously identified genetic signature of resistance (P {\textless} 0.0001), and together, the results identify virus neutralization as a correlate of protection. These findings further demonstrate the in vivo relevance of our previous in vitro analyses of the SIVsmE660 challenge stock, which revealed a broad range of neutralization sensitivities of its component viruses. In sum, this report demonstrates proof-of-concept that phenotypic sieve analyses can elucidate mechanistic correlates of immune protection following vaccination and raises a cautionary note for SIV and SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus) vaccine studies that employ challenge strains with envelope glycoproteins that fail to exhibit neutralization resistance profiles typical of TF viruses.
IMPORTANCE With more than 2 million new infections annually, the development of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is a global health priority. Understanding immunologic correlates of protection generated in vaccine trials is critical to advance vaccine development. Here, we assessed the role of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies in a recent nonhuman primate study of a vaccine that showed significant protection against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge and suggested a genetic signature of neutralization sensitivity. We found that breakthrough viruses able to establish infection in vaccinated animals were substantially more resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization than were viruses from controls. These findings suggest that vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies selectively blocked the transmission of more sensitive challenge viruses. Sieve analysis also corroborated a genetic signature of neutralization sensitivity and highlighted the impact of challenge swarm diversity. Our findings suggest an important role for neutralization sieve analyses as an informative component of comprehensive immune-correlates analyses.},

	abstract = {The goal of vaccination against infectious disease is a net population effect on the risk of infection and/or disease progression. In HIV-1 vaccine development efforts to date only a single HIV-1 vaccine trial has shown any efficacy by either of these measures. Despite this lack of success, we hope to inform future vaccine design by analyzing vaccine effects in HIV-1 vaccine trials. We expect to detect these effects through one of three measures: 1) differential vaccine-elicited responses among cases and controls in an immune correlates of risk analysis, 2) differential host genetics by treatment assignment among infected trial participants, or 3) differential viral genetics of breakthrough infecting strains by treatment assignment of the host (known as a sieve effect). In this thesis we begin by developing methods for aggregating biomarkers for use in an immune correlates of risk analysis via antigenic maps. We show that antigenic maps can be used as a bridge to understand connections between immune correlates of risk analysis results, differential host genetics and local effects in a sieve analysis. Next, we discuss the critical step of identifying panels of antigens for use in bioassays that can be used to generate antigenic maps and compare immune response outcomes between HIV-1 vaccine trials. The last part of this thesis develops sieve analysis methods that focus on epitopes, the underlying unit of the adaptive immune system response.},

We solved the crystal structure of human monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2158, which targets a conformational V2 epitope overlapping the α4β7 integrin binding site, and constructed a full-length model of V1V2. Comparison of computational energy stability to experimental enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results identified a hydrophobic core that stabilizes the V2 region for optimal 2158 binding, as well as residues that directly mediate side chain interactions with MAb 2158. These data define the binding surface recognized by MAb 2158 and offer a structural explanation for why a mismatched mutation at position 181 (I181X) in the V2 loop was associated with a higher vaccine efficiency in the RV144 clinical vaccine trial.
IMPORTANCE Correlate analysis of the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial suggested that the presence of antibodies to the second variable region (V2) of HIV-1 gp120 was responsible for the modest protection observed in the trial. V2 is a highly variable and immunogenic region, and structural information on its antigenic landscape will be important for rational design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. Using X-ray crystallography, computational design tools, and mutagenesis assays, we carried out a detailed and systematic investigation of the epitope recognition of human V2 MAb 2158 and demonstrated that its epitope region overlaps the integrin binding site within V2. In addition, we propose a structure-based mechanism for mismatching of the isoleucine at position 181 and the increased vaccine efficacy seen in the RV144 vaccine trial.},

Because of its limited efficacy, further understanding of the mechanisms of preventive AIDS vaccines remains a priority, and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of lentiviral infection provide an opportunity to define immunogens, vectors, and correlates of immunity. In this study, we show that prime-boost vaccination with a mismatched SIV envelope (Env) gene, derived from simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239, prevents infection by SIVsmE660 intrarectally. Analysis of different gene-based prime-boost immunization regimens revealed that recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) prime followed by replication-defective lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) boost elicited robust CD4 and CD8 T-cell and humoral immune responses. This vaccine protected against infection after repetitive mucosal challenge with efficacies of 82\% per exposure and 62\% cumulatively. No effect was seen on viremia in infected vaccinated monkeys compared to controls. Protection correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the challenge viruses tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These data indicate that a vaccine expressing a mismatched Env gene alone can prevent SIV infection in NHPs and identifies an immune correlate that may guide immunogen selection and immune monitoring for clinical efficacy trials.},

MethodsWithin the randomized trial (for vaccinees, n=3598; for placebo recipients, n=1805), binding and neutralizing antibody responses to rgp120 were quantitated. A case-cohort design was used to study correlations between antibody levels and HIV-1 incidence
ResultsPeak antibody levels were significantly inversely correlated with HIV-1 incidence. The relative risk (RR) of infection was 0.63 (95\% confidence interval, 0.45–0.89) per log10 higher neutralization titer against HIV-1MN, and the RRs of infection for second-, third-, and fourth-quartile responses of antibody blocking of gp120 binding to soluble CD4 versus first-quartile responses (the lowest responses) were 0.35, 0.28, and 0.22, respectively
ConclusionsDespite inducing a complex, robust immune response, the vaccine was unable to reduce the incidence of HIV-1. Two interpretations of the correlative results are that the levels of antibodies (i) caused both an increased (low responders) and decreased (high responders) risk of HIV-1 acquisition or (ii) represented a correlate of susceptibility to HIV-1 but had no causal effect on susceptibility. Although the data cannot definitively discriminate between these 2 explanations, (ii) appears to be more likely},

	abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have been isolated from selected HIV-1-infected individuals and shown to bind to conserved sites on the envelope glycoprotein (Env). However, circulating plasma virus in these donors is usually resistant to autologous isolated bNAbs, indicating that during chronic infection, HIV-1 can escape from even broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Here, we evaluate if such viral escape is associated with an impairment of viral replication. Antibodies of the VRC01 class target the functionally conserved CD4 binding site and share a structural mode of gp120 recognition that includes mimicry of the CD4 receptor. We examined naturally occurring VRC01-sensitive and -resistant viral strains, as well as their mutated sensitive or resistant variants, and tested point mutations in the backbone of the VRC01-sensitive isolate YU2. In several cases, VRC01 resistance was associated with a reduced efficiency of CD4-mediated viral entry and diminished viral replication. Several mutations, alone or in combination, in the loop D or β23-V5 region of Env conferred a high level of resistance to VRC01 class antibodies, suggesting a preferred escape pathway. We further mapped the VRC01-induced escape pathway in vivo using Envs from donor 45, from whom antibody VRC01 was isolated. Initial escape mutations, including the addition of a key glycan, occurred in loop D and were associated with impaired viral replication; however, compensatory mutations restored full replicative fitness. These data demonstrate that escape from VRC01 class antibodies can diminish viral replicative fitness, but compensatory changes may explain the limited impact of neutralizing antibodies during the course of natural HIV-1 infection.
IMPORTANCE Some antibodies that arise during natural HIV-1 infection bind to conserved regions on the virus envelope glycoprotein and potently neutralize the majority of diverse HIV-1 strains. The VRC01 class of antibodies blocks the conserved CD4 receptor binding site interaction that is necessary for viral entry, raising the possibility that viral escape from antibody neutralization might exert detrimental effects on viral function. Here, we show that escape from VRC01 class antibodies can be associated with impaired viral entry and replication; however, during the course of natural infection, compensatory mutations restore the ability of the virus to replicate normally.},

Resequencing is an emerging tool for the identification of rare disease-associated mutations. Recent studies have shown that groups of multiple rare mutations together can explain a large proportion of the genetic basis for some diseases. Therefore, we propose a new statistical method for analysing a group of mutations in order to test for groupwise association with disease status. We compare the proposed weighted-sum method to alternative methods and show that it is powerful for identifying disease-associated groups of mutations, both on computer-simulated and real data. By using computer simulations, we further show that resequencing a few thousand individuals is sufficient to perform a genome-wide study of all human genes, if the proposed method is used. This study thus demonstrates that resequencing studies can identify important genetic associations, provided that specialised analysis methods, such as the proposed weighted-sum method, are used.},

However, the rate of convergence of the Lasso is slow for some sparse high-dimensional data, where the number of predictor variables is growing fast with the number of observations. Moreover, many noise variables are selected if the estimator is chosen by cross-validation. It is shown that the contradicting demands of an efficient computational procedure and fast convergence rates of the ℓ 2 -loss can be overcome by a two-stage procedure, termed the relaxed Lasso. For orthogonal designs, the relaxed Lasso provides a continuum of solutions that include both soft- and hard-thresholding of estimators. The relaxed Lasso solutions include all regular Lasso solutions and computation of all relaxed Lasso solutions is often identically expensive as computing all regular Lasso solutions. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the relaxed Lasso produces sparser models with equal or lower prediction loss than the regular Lasso estimator for high-dimensional data.},

However, in this study we found that approximately 20\% of the trial participants possessed envelope proteins with an unusual number of cysteine residues that could very likely result in unusual protein structures. One class of variants included envelope proteins with two additional cysteine residues in close proximity, potentially yielding additional disulfide-bonded loops. Other classes of variants included envelope proteins where amino acid replacements increased or decreased the number of cysteine residues by one, resulting in molecules with either 19 or 17 cysteines, respectively. Initial functional analysis demonstrated that envelope proteins with 19 cysteine residues bind to CD4 and the CCR5 chemokine coreceptor, and are infectious. These results suggest that the protein structure of gp120 in newly transmitted viruses may be more heterogeneous than previously appreciated and potentially represent a new mechanism of virus variation. The disulfide variation that we report here may have important implications for HIV vaccine and drug development efforts.},

	abstract = {Summary This article introduces methods for use in vaccine clinical trials to help determine whether the immune response to a vaccine is actually causing a reduction in the infection rate. This is not easy because immune response to the (say HIV) vaccine is only observed in the HIV vaccine arm. If we knew what the HIV-specific immune response in placebo recipients would have been, had they been vaccinated, this immune response could be treated essentially like a baseline covariate and an interaction with treatment could be evaluated. Relatedly, the rate of infection by this baseline covariate could be compared between the two groups and a causative role of immune response would be supported if infection risk decreased with increasing HIV immune response only in the vaccine group. We introduce two methods for inferring this HIV-specific immune response. The first involves vaccinating everyone before baseline with an irrelevant vaccine, for example, rabies. Randomization ensures that the relationship between the immune responses to the rabies and HIV vaccines observed in the vaccine group is the same as what would have been seen in the placebo group. We infer a placebo volunteer's response to the HIV vaccine using their rabies response and a prediction model from the vaccine group. The second method entails vaccinating all uninfected placebo patients at the closeout of the trial with the HIV vaccine and recording immune response. We pretend this immune response at closeout is what they would have had at baseline. We can then infer what the distribution of immune response among placebo infecteds would have been. Such designs may help elucidate the role of immune response in preventing infections. More pointedly, they could be helpful in the decision to improve or abandon an HIV vaccine with mediocre performance in a phase III trial.},

Statistical and sequence analysis methods provide opportunities to mine the mechanisms behind the effect of an HIV vaccine.
RECENT FINDINGS: The release of results from two HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials, Step/HVTN-502 (HIV Vaccine Trials Network-502) and RV144, led to numerous studies in the last 5 years, including efforts to sequence HIV-1 breakthrough infections and compare viral characteristics between the vaccine and placebo groups. Novel genetic and statistical analysis methods uncovered features that distinguished founder viruses isolated from vaccinees from those isolated from placebo recipients, and identified HIV-1 genetic targets of vaccine-induced immune responses.
SUMMARY: Studies of HIV-1 breakthrough infections in vaccine efficacy trials can provide an independent confirmation to correlates of risk studies, as they take advantage of vaccine/placebo comparisons, whereas correlates of risk analyses are limited to vaccine recipients. Through the identification of viral determinants impacted by vaccine-mediated host immune responses, sieve analyses can shed light on potential mechanisms of vaccine protection.},

	abstract = {Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 typically results in one genetic variant establishing systemic infection. We compared, for 137 linked transmission pairs, the amino acid sequences encoded by non-envelope genes of viruses in both partners and demonstrate a selection bias for transmission of residues that are predicted to confer increased in vivo fitness on viruses in the newly infected, immunologically naïve recipient. Although tempered by transmission risk factors, such as donor viral load, genital inflammation, and recipient gender, this selection bias provides an overall transmission advantage for viral quasispecies that are dominated by viruses with high in vivo fitness. Thus, preventative or therapeutic approaches that even marginally reduce viral fitness may lower the overall transmission rates and offer long-term benefits even upon successful transmission.
Introduction Heterosexual HIV-1 transmission is an inefficient process with rates reported at {\textless}1\% per unprotected sexual exposure. When transmission occurs, systemic infection is typically established by a single genetic variant, taken from the swarm of genetically distinct viruses circulating in the donor. Whether that founder virus represents a chance event or was systematically favored is unclear. Our work has tested a central hypothesis that founder virus selection is biased toward certain genetic characteristics.
Fitter viruses (red) are favored more in woman-to-man (bottom curve) than in man-to-woman (top curve) transmission. The probability that a majority donor amino acid variant is transmitted is a function of relative fitness, here estimated by the frequency of the variant in the Zambian population. Even residues common in the population are less likely to be transmitted to healthy men than to women, indicative of higher selection bias in woman-to-man transmission.
Rationale If HIV-1 transmission involves selection for viruses with certain favorable characteristics, then such advantages should emerge as statistical biases when viewed across many viral loci in many transmitting partners. We therefore identified 137 Zambian heterosexual transmission pairs, for whom plasma samples were available for both the donor and recipient partner soon after transmission, and compared the viral sequences obtained from each partner to identify features that predicted whether the majority amino acid observed at any particular position in the donor was transmitted. We focused attention on two features: viral genetic characteristics that correlate with viral fitness, and clinical factors that influence transmission. Statistical modeling indicates that the former will be favored for transmission, while the latter will nullify this relative advantage.
Results We observed a highly significant selection bias that favors the transmission of amino acids associated with increased fitness. These features included the frequency of the amino acid in the study cohort, the relative advantage of the amino acid with respect to the stability of the protein, and features related to immune escape and compensation. This selection bias was reduced in couples with high risk of transmission. In particular, significantly less selection bias was observed in men with genital inflammation and in women (regardless of inflammation status), compared to healthy men, suggesting a more permissive environment in the female than male genital tract. Consistent with this observation, viruses transmitted to women were characterized by lower predicted fitness than those in men. The presence of amino acids favored during transmission predicted which individual virus within a donor was transmitted to their partner, while chronically infected individuals with viral populations characterized by a predominance of these amino acids were more likely to transmit to their partners.
Conclusion These data highlight the clear selection biases that benefit fitter viruses during transmission in the context of a stochastic process. That such biases exist, and are tempered by certain risk factors, suggests that transmission is frequently characterized by many abortive transmission events in which some target cells are nonproductively infected. Moreover, for efficient transmission, some changes that favored survival in the transmitting partner are frequently discarded, resulting in overall slower evolution of HIV-1 in the population. Paradoxically, by increasing the selection bias at the transmission bottleneck, reduction of susceptibility may increase the expected fitness of breakthrough viruses that establish infection and may therefore worsen the prognosis for the newly infected partner. Conversely, preventive or therapeutic approaches that weaken the virus may reduce overall transmission rates via a mechanism that is independent from the quantity of circulating virus, and may therefore provide long-term benefits to the recipient if transmission does occur.
HIV needs to be fit to transmit
Although you might not think it, it's hard to catch HIV. Less than 1\% of unprotected sexual exposures result in infection. What then leads to transmission? Carlson et al. determined the amino acid sequence of viruses infecting 137 Zambian heterosexual couples in which one partner infected the other (see the Perspective by Joseph and Swanstrom). The authors then used statistical modeling and found that transmitted viruses are typically the most evolutionarily fit. That is, compared to other viral variants in the infected person, the transmitted virus most closely matches the most common viral sequence found in the Zambian population.

	abstract = {BackgroundRecombinant gp120 (MN-rgp120) was a major component of the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial. This was the first clinical trial to show that vaccination could prevent HIV infection in humans. A recent RV144 correlates of protection study found that protection correlated with the presence of antibodies to the V2 domain. It has been proposed that antibodies to the α4β7 binding site in the V2 domain might prevent HIV-1 infection by blocking the ability of virions to recognize α4β7 on activated T-cells. In this study we investigated the specificity of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the V2 domain of MN-rgp120 and examined the possibility that these antibodies could inhibit the binding of MN-rgp120 to the α4β7 integrin.Methodology/Principal FindingsNine MAbs to the V2 domain were isolated from mice immunized with recombinant envelope proteins. The ability of these MAbs to inhibit HIV infection, block the binding of gp120 to CD4, and block the binding of MN-rgp120 to the α4β7 integrin was measured. Mutational analysis showed that eight of the MAbs recognized two immunodominant clusters of amino acids (166–168 and 178–183) located at either end of the C strand within the four-strand anti-parallel sheet structure comprising the V1/V2 domain.Conclusions/SignificanceThese studies showed that the antigenic structure of the V2 domain is exceedingly complex and that MAbs isolated from mice immunized with MN-rgp120 exhibited a high level of strain specificity compared to MAbs to the V2 domain isolated from HIV-infected humans. We found that immunization with MN-rgp120 readily elicits antibodies to the V2 domain and some of these were able to block the binding of MN-rgp120 to the α4β7 integrin.},

To describe recruitment and baseline epidemiologic characteristics of volunteers in the first phase 3 placebo-controlled trial of a recombinant gp120 HIV vaccine (AIDSVAX B/B).


METHODS

Volunteers were gay/bisexual men or women at risk for sexually transmitted HIV infection. Recruitment strategies, demographics, and risk factors were assessed. HIV status was determined by standard HIV-1 antibody assays. Seronegative/viremic HIV infection at enrollment was determined using the HIV-1 nucleic acid test.


RESULTS

From June 1998 through October 1999, 5417 of 7185 volunteers screened were enrolled at 61 sites in the United States, Canada, and The Netherlands. Successful recruitment methods included distribution of study information at gay venues, advertising and media coverage, and referrals from volunteers. Most volunteers were altruistically motivated, men (98\%), young (median, 36 years), white (83\%), well educated (61\% college education or more), and at high risk for HIV during the 6 months before enrollment. At baseline, 14 were HIV infected (12 were seronegative but viremic; 2 were seropositive and viremic).


CONCLUSION

Men and women at high risk for sexually transmitted HIV infection were successfully recruited for the first phase 3 HIV vaccine efficacy trial. Knowledge of recruitment and baseline epidemiologic characteristics of participants in this trial will provide valuable guidance for designing and conducting future trials.},

Five of seven potential glycosylation sites are utilized when the virus is grown in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with the nonutilized sites lying within the V4 loop. Elimination of glycans within and adjacent to the V3 loop renders SF162 more susceptible to neutralization by polyclonal HIV+-positive and simian/human immunodeficiency virus-positive sera and by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognizing the V3 loop, the CD4- and CCR5-binding sites, and the extracellular region of gp41. Importantly, our studies also indicate that glycans located within the immunologically silent face of gp120, specifically the C4 and V5 regions, also conferred on SF162 resistance to neutralization by anti-V3 loop, anti-CD4 binding site, and anti-gp41 MAbs but not by antibodies targeting the coreceptor binding site. We also observed that the amino acid composition of the V4 region contributes to the neutralization phenotype of SF162 by anti-V3 loop and anti-CD4 binding site MAbs. Collectively, our data support the proposal that the glycosylation and structure of the immunologically silent face of the HIV envelope plays an important role in defining the neutralization phenotype of HIV type 1.},

How to compare principal surrogate value of biomarkers or general risk models that consider multiple biomarkers remains an open research question. We propose to characterize a marker or risk model's principal surrogate value based on the distribution of risk difference between interventions. In addition, we propose a novel summary measure (the standardized total gain) that can be used to compare markers and to assess the incremental value of a new marker. We develop a semiparametric estimated-likelihood method to estimate the joint surrogate value of multiple biomarkers. This method accommodates two-phase sampling of biomarkers and is more widely applicable than existing nonparametric methods by incorporating continuous baseline covariates to predict the biomarker(s), and is more robust than existing parametric methods by leaving the error distribution of markers unspecified. The methodology is illustrated using a simulated example set and a real data set in the context of HIV vaccine trials.},

	abstract = {The mammalian APOBEC3 proteins are an important component of the cellular innate immune response to retroviral infection. APOBEC3G can extinguish HIV-1 infectivity by its incorporation into virus particles and subsequent cytosine deaminase activity that attacks the nascent viral cDNA during reverse transcription, causing lethal mutagenesis. It has been suggested, but not formally shown, that APOBEC3G can also induce sublethal mutagenesis, which would maintain virus infectivity and contribute to HIV-1 variation. To test this, we developed a novel model system utilizing an HIV-1 vector and a panel of APOBEC3G-expressing cells. We observed proviruses with single APOBEC3G-mediated mutations (in the presence or absence of Vif), occurring at distinct hot spots and which could be rescued and shown to have infectivity. These data indicate that APOBEC3G-dependent restriction of HIV-1 can result in viable viral progeny that harbor sublethal levels of G-to-A mutations. Such mutations have the potential to contribute significantly to HIV-1 evolution, pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance.},

	abstract = {A vaccine capable of stimulating protective antiviral antibody responses is needed to curtail the global AIDS epidemic caused by HIV-1. Although rarely elicited during the course of natural infection or upon conventional vaccination, the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of the HIV-1 glycoprotein of M(r) 41,000 (gp41) envelope protein subunit is the target of 3 such human broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs): 4E10, 2F5, and Z13e1. How these BNAbs bind to their lipid-embedded epitopes and mediate antiviral activity is unclear, but such information might offer important insight into a worldwide health imperative. Here, EPR and NMR techniques were used to define the manner in which these BNAbs differentially recognize viral membrane-encrypted residues configured within the L-shaped helix-hinge-helix MPER segment. Two distinct modes of antibody-mediated interference of viral infection were identified. 2F5, like 4E10, induces large conformational changes in the MPER relative to the membrane. However, although 4E10 straddles the hinge and extracts residues W672 and F673, 2F5 lifts up residues N-terminal to the hinge region, exposing L669 and W670. In contrast, Z13e1 effects little change in membrane orientation or conformation, but rather immobilizes the MPER hinge through extensive rigidifying surface contacts. Thus, BNAbs disrupt HIV-1 MPER fusogenic functions critical for virus entry into human CD4 T cells and macrophages either by preventing hinge motion or by perturbing MPER orientation. HIV-1 MPER features important for targeted vaccine design have been revealed, the implications of which extend to BNAb targets on other viral fusion proteins.},

Subsequently, we apply this improved covariance estimator (which has guaranteed minimum mean squared error, is well-conditioned, and is always positive definite even for small sample sizes) to the problem of inferring large-scale gene association networks. We show that it performs very favorably compared to competing approaches both in simulations as well as in application to real expression data.},

In infected cells, gp160 is found not only on the plasma membrane but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Our aim was to establish rate-determining steps in the maturation process of gp160, using a radioactive pulse-chase approach. We found that gp160 has an intricate folding process: disulfide bonds start to form during synthesis but undergo extensive isomerization until the correct native conformation is reached. Removal of the leader peptide critically depends on formation of at least some disulfide bonds in subunit gp120 during folding. Envelope folds extremely slowly and therefore resides in the ER longer than other proteins, but the yield of properly folded molecules is high and degradation is undetectable. The large quantity of gp160 in the ER hence is a result of its slow transit through this compartment. We show here that newly synthesized HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein apparently follows a slow but high-yield folding path in which co- and post-translational formation of disulfide bonds in gp120, disulfide isomerization and conformation dependent removal of the leader sequence are determining and intertwined events.},

	abstract = {Background. Trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) is known to interfere with monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) immunogenicity. Interference with bivalent and monovalent OPV formulations, which will be increasingly used globally in coming years, has not been examined. We conducted a post-hoc analysis to assess the interference of co-administration of different OPV formulations on RV1 immunogenicity.
Methods. Healthy infants in Matlab, Bangladesh were randomized to receive 3 doses of monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1) or bivalent OPV 1+3 (bOPV) at 6, 8 and 10 weeks or at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age; or tOPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. All infants received two doses of RV1 at around 6 and 10 weeks of age. Concomitant administration was defined as RV1 and OPV given on the same day; staggered administration as RV1 and OPV given ≥1 day apart. Rotavirus seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold rise in IgA titer from before the 1st RV1 dose to ≥3 weeks after 2nd RV1 dose.
Results. There were no significant differences in baseline RV1 immunogenicity among the 409 infants included in the final analysis. Infants who received RV1 and OPV concomitantly, regardless of OPV formulation, were less likely to seroconvert (47\% [95\% CI: 39-54\%]) compared to those that received both vaccines staggered ≥1 day (63\% [95\% CI: 57\%-70\%], p{\textless}0.001). For staggered administration, we found no evidence that the length of interval between RV1 and OPV administration affected RV1 immunogenicity.
Conclusion. Co-administration of mOPV1, bOPV or tOPV appears to lower RV1 immunogenicity.},

	abstract = {Five preventative HIV vaccine efficacy trials have been conducted over the last 12 years, all of which evaluated vaccine efficacy (VE) to prevent HIV infection for a single vaccine regimen versus placebo. Now that one of these trials has supported partial VE of a prime-boost vaccine regimen, there is interest in conducting efficacy trials that simultaneously evaluate multiple prime-boost vaccine regimens against a shared placebo group in the same geographic region, for accelerating the pace of vaccine development. This article proposes such a design, which has main objectives (1) to evaluate VE of each regimen versus placebo against HIV exposures occurring near the time of the immunizations; (2) to evaluate durability of VE for each vaccine regimen showing reliable evidence for positive VE; (3) to expeditiously evaluate the immune correlates of protection if any vaccine regimen shows reliable evidence for positive VE; and (4) to compare VE among the vaccine regimens. The design uses sequential monitoring for the events of vaccine harm, non-efficacy, and high efficacy, selected to weed out poor vaccines as rapidly as possible while guarding against prematurely weeding out a vaccine that does not confer efficacy until most of the immunizations are received. The evaluation of the design shows that testing multiple vaccine regimens is important for providing a well-powered assessment of the correlation of vaccine-induced immune responses with HIV infection, and is critically important for providing a reasonably powered assessment of the value of identified correlates as surrogate endpoints for HIV infection.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In the Step Study, the MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine did not reduce plasma viraemia after infection, and HIV-1 incidence was higher in vaccine-treated than in placebo-treated men with pre-existing adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. We assessed vaccine-induced immunity and its potential contributions to infection risk.
Methods
To assess immunogenicity, we characterised HIV-specific T cells ex vivo with validated interferon-γ ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays, using a case–cohort design. To establish effects of vaccine and pre-existing Ad5 immunity on infection risk, we undertook flow cytometric studies to measure Ad5-specific T cells and circulating activated (Ki-67+/BcL-2lo) CD4+ T cells expressing CCR5.
Findings
We detected interferon-γ-secreting HIV-specific T cells (range 163/106 to 686/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) ex vivo by ELISPOT in 77\% (258/354) of people receiving vaccine; 218 of 354 (62\%) recognised two to three HIV proteins. We identified HIV-specific CD4+ T cells by intracellular cytokine staining in 58 of 142 (41\%) people. In those with reactive CD4+ T cells, the median percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing interleukin 2 was 88\%, and the median co-expression of interferon γ or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), or both, was 72\%. We noted HIV-specific CD8+ T cells (range 0·4–1·0\%) in 117 of 160 (73\%) participants, expressing predominantly either interferon γ alone or with TNFα. Vaccine-induced HIV-specific immunity, including response rate, magnitude, and cytokine profile, did not differ between vaccinated male cases (before infection) and non-cases. Ad5-specific T cells were lower in cases than in non-cases in several subgroup analyses. The percentage of circulating Ki-67+BcL-2lo/CCR5+CD4+ T cells did not differ between cases and non-cases.
Interpretation
Consistent with previous trials, the MRKAd5 HIV-1 gag/pol/nef vaccine was highly immunogenic for inducing HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Our findings suggest that future candidate vaccines have to elicit responses that either exceed in magnitude or differ in breadth or function from those recorded in this trial.

However, the impact of infected target cell migration on antigen recognition by HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells is unclear. Using a 3D in vitro model of tissue, we visualized dynamic interactions between HIV-infected or peptide-pulsed CD4+ T-cells and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells. CTLs engaged motile HIV-infected targets, but ∼50\% of targets broke contact and escaped. In contrast, immobilized target cells were readily killed, indicating target motility directly inhibits CD8+ T-cell function. Strong calcium signals occurred in CTLs killing a motile target but calcium signaling was weak or absent in CTLs which permitted target escape. Neutralization of adhesion receptors LFA-1 and CD58 inhibited CD8+ T-cell function within the 3D matrix, demonstrating that efficient motile target lysis as dependent on adhesive engagement of targets. Antigen sensitivity (a convolution of antigen density, TCR avidity and CD8 coreceptor binding) is also critical for target recognition. We modulated this parameter (known as functional avidity but referred to here as “avidity” for the sake of simplicity) by exploiting common HIV escape mutations and measured their impact on CTL function at the single-cell level. Targets pulsed with low avidity mutant antigens frequently escaped while CTLs killed targets bearing high avidity antigen with near-perfect efficiency. CTLs engaged, arrested, and killed an initial target bearing high avidity antigen within minutes, but serial killing was surprisingly rare. CD8 cells remained committed to their initial dead target for hours, accumulating TCR signals that sustained secretion of soluble antiviral factors. These data indicate that high-avidity CD8+ T-cells execute an antiviral program in the precise location where antigen has been sensed: CTL effector functions are spatiotemporally coordinated with an early lytic phase followed by a sustained stationary secretory phase to control local viral infection.},

Moderate treatment differences in visit adherence, either through missed visits or additional unscheduled visits, were not found to cause substantial bias or to reduce power.

MethodsWithin the randomized trial (for vaccinees, n=3598; for placebo recipients, n=1805), binding and neutralizing antibody responses to rgp120 were quantitated. A case-cohort design was used to study correlations between antibody levels and HIV-1 incidence
ResultsPeak antibody levels were significantly inversely correlated with HIV-1 incidence. The relative risk (RR) of infection was 0.63 (95\% confidence interval, 0.45–0.89) per log10 higher neutralization titer against HIV-1MN, and the RRs of infection for second-, third-, and fourth-quartile responses of antibody blocking of gp120 binding to soluble CD4 versus first-quartile responses (the lowest responses) were 0.35, 0.28, and 0.22, respectively
ConclusionsDespite inducing a complex, robust immune response, the vaccine was unable to reduce the incidence of HIV-1. Two interpretations of the correlative results are that the levels of antibodies (i) caused both an increased (low responders) and decreased (high responders) risk of HIV-1 acquisition or (ii) represented a correlate of susceptibility to HIV-1 but had no causal effect on susceptibility. Although the data cannot definitively discriminate between these 2 explanations, (ii) appears to be more likely},

	abstract = {Background. Women in Africa, especially young women, have very high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence rates that cannot be fully explained by behavioral risks. We investigated whether genital inflammation influenced HIV acquisition in this group.
Methods. Twelve selected cytokines, including 9 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, interferon-γ inducible protein-10 [IP-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1α, MIP-1β), hematopoietic IL-7, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and regulatory IL-10 were measured prior to HIV infection in cervicovaginal lavages from 58 HIV seroconverters and 58 matched uninfected controls and in plasma from a subset of 107 of these women from the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa 004 tenofovir gel trial.
Results. HIV seroconversion was associated with raised genital inflammatory cytokines (including chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and IP-10). The risk of HIV acquisition was significantly higher in women with evidence of genital inflammation, defined by at least 5 of 9 inflammatory cytokines being raised (odds ratio, 3.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3–7.9; P = .014). Genital cytokine concentrations were persistently raised (for about 1 year before infection), with no readily identifiable cause despite extensive investigation of several potential factors, including sexually transmitted infections and systemic cytokines.
Conclusions. Elevated genital concentrations of HIV target cell–recruiting chemokines and a genital inflammatory profile contributes to the high risk of HIV acquisition in these African women.},

	abstract = {Processing of viral proteins for recognition by CTL involves degradation of the proteins in the cytosol of an infected cell followed by transport of the resulting peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the TAP1/2 complex. Uncertainty exists over the site of processing of viral envelope (env) proteins since the extracellular domains of env proteins are not present in the cytosol where the class I Ag-processing pathway begins. Rather, the ectodomains of env proteins are cotranslationally translocated into the ER during biosynthesis. To analyze env protein processing, we used the herpes simplex virus protein ICP47 to block peptide transport by TAP1/2 and examined the effects of TAP blockade on the processing of the HIV-1 env protein. For the majority of env-specific CD8+ CTL, the processing pathway required TAP1/2-mediated transport of cytosolic peptides into the ER. To determine how env peptides are generated in the cytosol, we analyzed the processing of two TAP1/2-dependent epitopes containing N-linked glycosylation sites. In each case, processing involved glycosylation-dependent posttranslational modification of asparagine residues to aspartic acid. These results are consistent with cotranslational translocation of env into the ER, where glycosylation occurs. This is followed by export of a fraction of the newly synthesized protein into the cytosol, where it is deglycosylated, with conversion of the asparagines to aspartic acid residues. Following cytoplasmic proteolysis, env peptides are retransported by TAP1/2 into the ER, where association with class I occurs. Thus, the env protein can enter the class I pathway through multiple distinct processing mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Stepped wedge designs are increasingly commonplace and advantageous for cluster randomized trials when it is both unethical to assign placebo, and it is logistically difficult to allocate an intervention simultaneously to many clusters. We study marginal mean models fit with generalized estimating equations for assessing treatment effectiveness in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials. This approach has advantages over the more commonly used mixed models that (1) the population-average parameters have an important interpretation for public health applications and (2) they avoid untestable assumptions on latent variable distributions and avoid parametric assumptions about error distributions, therefore, providing more robust evidence on treatment effects. However, cluster randomized trials typically have a small number of clusters, rendering the standard generalized estimating equation sandwich variance estimator biased and highly variable and hence yielding incorrect inferences. We study the usual asymptotic generalized estimating equation inferences (i.e., using sandwich variance estimators and asymptotic normality) and four small-sample corrections to generalized estimating equation for stepped wedge cluster randomized trials and for parallel cluster randomized trials as a comparison. We show by simulation that the small-sample corrections provide improvement, with one correction appearing to provide at least nominal coverage even with only 10 clusters per group. These results demonstrate the viability of the marginal mean approach for both stepped wedge and parallel cluster randomized trials. We also study the comparative performance of the corrected methods for stepped wedge and parallel designs, and describe how the methods can accommodate interval censoring of individual failure times and incorporate semiparametric efficient estimators.},

	abstract = {Monospecific antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide K159 (SQGVVESMNKELKKIIGQVRDQAEHLKTA) reproducing the segment 147-175 of HIV-1 integrase (IN). Synthesis of substituted and truncated analogs of K159 led us to identify the functional epitope reacting with antibodies within the C-terminal portion 163-175 of K159. Conformational studies combining secondary structure predictions, CD and NMR spectroscopy together with ELISA assays, showed that the greater is the propensity of the epitope for helix formation the higher is the recognition by anti-K159. Both the antibodies and the antigenic peptide K159 exhibited inhibitory activities against IN. In contrast, neither P159, a Pro-containing analog of K159 that presents a kink around proline but with intact epitope conformation, nor the truncated analogs encompassing the epitope, were inhibitors of IN. While the activity of antibodies is restricted to recognition of the sole epitope portion, that of the antigenic K159 likely requires interactions of the peptide with the whole 147-175 segment in the protein [Sourgen F., Maroun, R.G., Frère, V., Bouziane, A., Auclair, C., Troalen, F. \& Fermandjian, S. (1996) Eur. J. Biochem. 240, 765-773]. Actually, of all tested peptides only K159 was found to fulfill condition of minimal number of helical heptads to achieve the formation of a stable coiled-coil structure with the IN 147-175 segment. The binding of antibodies and of the antigenic peptide to this segment of IN hampers the binding of IN to its DNA substrates in filter-binding assays. This appears to be the main effect leading to inhibition of integration. Quantitative analysis of filter-binding assay curves indicates that two antibody molecules react with IN implying that the enzyme is dimeric within these experimental conditions. Together, present data provide an insight into the structure-function relationship for the 147-175 peptide domain of the enzyme. They also strongly suggest that the functional enzyme is dimeric. Results could help to assess models for binding of peptide fragments to IN and to develop stronger inhibitors. Moreover, K159 antibodies when expressed in vivo might exhibit useful inhibitory properties.},

Significant efforts have been made toward the design, engineering, and expression of various soluble forms of HIV Env immunogen, yet a highly effective immunogen remains elusive. One of the key challenges in the development of an effective HIV vaccine is the presence of the complex set of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on Env, namely, glycosylation and disulfide bonds, that affect protein folding, epitope accessibility, and immunogenecity. Although these PTMs vary with expression systems, variations in Env?s PTMs due to changes in the expression method are not yet well established. In this study, we compared the disulfide bond network and glycosylation profiles of clade C recombinant HIV-1 Env trimers, C97ZA012 gp140, expressed by stable and transient transfections using an integrated mass mapping workflow that combines collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD). Site-specific analysis of the N- and O-glycosylation profiles revealed that C97ZA012 gp140 produced by both transfection methods displayed a high degree of similarity in N-glycosylation profiles and site occupancy except for one site. By contrast, different O-glycosylation profiles were detected. Analysis of the disulfide bond networks of the Env revealed that both transfection methods yielded C97ZA012 gp140 adopting the expected disulfide bond pattern identified for the monomeric gp120 and gp41 as well as alternative disulfide bond patterns in the C1, V1/V2, and C2 regions. The finding that disulfide bonding is consistently heterogeneous in these proteins is perhaps the most significant outcome of these studies; this disulfide heterogeneity has been reported for multiple other recombinant gp140s, and it is likely present in most recombinantly expressed Env immunogens.},

	abstract = {Context:
Vitamin D is a potent secosteroid hormone that provides many skeletal and extraskeletal health benefits. Musculoskeletal injury prevention and recovery are potentially affected by sufficient circulating levels of the storage form of vitamin D: 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, or 25(OH)D. Vitamin D deficiency can exist among young, active, and healthy people, which may put them at increased risk for injury and prolonged recovery.

Evidence Aquisition:
PubMed was searched using vitamin D and skeletal muscle, vitamin D and athletic performance, and vitamin D review articles. Studies from the 1930s to 2012 were used for the review.

Results:
There is strong correlation between vitamin D sufficiency and optimal muscle function. Increasing levels of vitamin D reduce inflammation, pain, and myopathy while increasing muscle protein synthesis, ATP concentration, strength, jump height, jump velocity, jump power, exercise capacity, and physical performance. 25(OH)D levels above 40 ng/mL are required for fracture prevention, including stress fractures. Optimal musculoskeletal benefits occur at 25(OH)D levels above the current definition of sufficiency ({\textgreater} 30 ng/mL) with no reported sports health benefits above 50 ng/mL.

Conclusions:
Vitamin D deficiency is common in athletes. For athletes presenting with stress fractures, musculoskeletal pain, and frequent illness, one should have a heightened awareness of the additional likely diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency. Correction of this deficiency is completed by standardized and supervised oral supplementation protocols producing significant musculoskeletal sports health benefits.},

Understanding of the mechanism for this strong effect remains incomplete. HLA-B*57 alleles and the closely related HLA-B*5801 are often grouped together because of their similar peptide-binding motifs and HIV disease outcome associations. However, we show here that the apparently small differences between HLA-B*57 alleles, termed HLA-B*57 micropolymorphisms, have a significant impact on immune control of HIV. In a study cohort of {\textgreater}2,000 HIV C-clade-infected subjects from southern Africa, HLA-B*5703 is associated with a lower viral-load set point than HLA-B*5702 and HLA-B*5801 (medians, 5,980, 15,190, and 19,000 HIV copies/ml plasma; P = 0.24 and P = 0.0005). In order to better understand these observed differences in HLA-B*57/5801-mediated immune control of HIV, we undertook, in a study of {\textgreater}1,000 C-clade-infected subjects, a comprehensive analysis of the epitopes presented by these 3 alleles and of the selection pressure imposed on HIV by each response. In contrast to previous studies, we show that each of these three HLA alleles is characterized both by unique CD8+ T-cell specificities and by clear-cut differences in selection pressure imposed on the virus by those responses. These studies comprehensively define for the first time the CD8+ T-cell responses and immune selection pressures for which these protective alleles are responsible. These findings are consistent with HLA class I alleles mediating effective immune control of HIV through the number of p24 Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses generated that can drive significant selection pressure on the virus.},

	abstract = {Summary
The global diversity of HIV-1 represents a critical challenge facing HIV-1 vaccine development. HIV-1 mosaic antigens are bioinformatically optimized immunogens designed for improved coverage of HIV-1 diversity. However, the protective efficacy of such global HIV-1 vaccine antigens has not previously been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of bivalent HIV-1 mosaic antigens to protect rhesus monkeys against acquisition of infection following heterologous challenges with the difficult-to-neutralize simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3. Adenovirus/poxvirus and adenovirus/adenovirus vector-based vaccines expressing HIV-1 mosaic Env, Gag, and Pol afforded a significant reduction in the per-exposure acquisition risk following repetitive, intrarectal SHIV-SF162P3 challenges. Protection against acquisition of infection correlated with vaccine-elicited binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the coordinated activity of multiple antibody functions may contribute to protection against difficult-to-neutralize viruses. These data demonstrate the protective efficacy of HIV-1 mosaic antigens and suggest a potential strategy for the development of a global HIV-1 vaccine.

	abstract = {The structure of the free form HIV gp120, critical for therapeutic agent development, is unavailable due to its high flexibility. Previous thermodynamic data, structural analysis and simulation results have suggested a large conformational change in the core domain upon CD4 binding. The bridging sheet, which consists of four β-strands with β20/21 nestling against the inner/outer domains and β2/3 facing outward, more exposed to the solvent, was proposed to be unfolded in the native state. In order to test this proposition and to characterize the native conformations, we performed potential mean force (PMF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the CD4-bound crystal structure. We pushed the bridging sheet away from the inner and outer domain to explore the accessible conformational space for the bridging sheet. In addition, we performed conventional MD simulations on structures with the bridging sheet partially unfolded to investigate the stability of the association between the inner and outer domains. Based on the free energy profiles, we find that the whole bridging sheet is unlikely to unfold without other concurrent conformational changes. On the other hand, the partial bridging sheet, β strands 2/3, can switch its conformation from the folded to the unfolded state. Furthermore, relaxation of conformation with partially unfolded bridging sheet through MD simulations leads to a conformation with β strands 20/21 quickly re-anchoring against the inner and outer domains. Such a conformation, although lacking some of the hydrophobic interactions present in the CD4-bound structure, displayed high stability as further indicated by other restrained MD simulations. The relevance of this conformation to the free form structure and the pathway for conformational change from the free form to the CD4-bound structure is discussed in detail in light of the available unliganded SIV gp120 crystal structure.},

Human T-cell leukaemia virus types-1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) are divergent blood borne viruses that cause hematological malignancies in humans and cattle respectively. In common with other enveloped viruses, infection of cells by HTLV-1 and BLV is dependent on the membrane fusion properties of the viral envelope glycoproteins. Here we have solved the crystal structure of the BLV transmembrane glycoprotein, and, through a functional and comparative analysis with HTLV-1, we have identified features that are critical to fusion protein function. In particular, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions with small ions dramatically stabilize the assembly and fusion-associated forms of the BLV TM, but are not required for the cell surface display of native pre-fusogenic envelope. Moreover, we show that charged residues that border a deep hydrophobic pocket contribute directly to appropriate folding of fusion-active envelope and are critical to membrane fusion. Importantly, the charged residues that border the pocket are key features that determine the specificity and activity of peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Our study demonstrates that charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are significant leitmotifs of diverse class-1 fusion proteins and that these elements represent ideal targets for novel small-molecule inhibitors of viral entry.},

	abstract = {The ability of CD8+ T cells to effectively limit HIV-1 replication and block HIV-1 acquisition is determined by the capacity to rapidly respond to HIV-1 antigens. Understanding both the functional properties and regulation of an effective CD8+ response would enable better evaluation of T cell-directed vaccine strategies and may inform the design of new therapies. We assessed the antigen specificity, cytokine signature, and mechanisms that regulate antiviral gene expression in CD8+ T cells from a cohort of HIV-1-infected virus controllers (VCs) ({\textless}5,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml and CD4+ lymphocyte counts of {\textgreater}400 cells/μl) capable of soluble inhibition of HIV-1. Gag p24 and Nef CD8+ T cell-specific soluble virus inhibition was common among the VCs and correlated with substantial increases in the abundance of mRNAs encoding the antiviral cytokines macrophage inflammatory proteins MIP-1α, MIP-1αP (CCL3L1), and MIP-1β; granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); lymphotactin (XCL1); tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 (TNFRSF9); and gamma interferon (IFN-γ). The induction of several of these mRNAs was driven through a coordinated response of both increased transcription and stabilization of mRNA, which together accounted for the observed increase in mRNA abundance. This coordinated response allows rapid and robust induction of mRNA messages that can enhance the CD8+ T cells' ability to inhibit virus upon antigen encounter.
IMPORTANCE We show that mRNA stability, in addition to transcription, is key in regulating the direct anti-HIV-1 function of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells. Regulation at the level of RNA helps enable rapid recall of memory CD8+ T cell effector functions for HIV-1 inhibition. By uncovering and understanding the mechanisms employed by CD8+ T cell subsets with antigen-specific anti-HIV-1 activity, we can identify new strategies for comprehensive identification of other important antiviral genes. This will, in turn, enhance our ability to inhibit virus replication by informing both cure strategies and HIV-1 vaccine designs that aim to reduce transmission and can aid in blocking HIV-1 acquisition.},

Instead a conserved minimal upstream open reading frame (uORF) consisting only of a start and stop codon that overlaps with the vpu start site, appears to augment access to the env start codon downstream. Mutating the translational start and stop codons of this uORF resulted in up to fivefold reduction in Env expression. Removing the vpu uORF and increasing the strength of the authentic vpu initiation sequence abolished Env expression from subgenomic constructs and replication of HIV-1, whereas an identical increase in the strength of the minimal uORF initiation site did not alter Env expression.},

Structurally, BST-2 consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, an ectodomain, and a C-terminal membrane anchor. The BST-2 ectodomain encodes three cysteine residues in its N-terminal half, each of which can contribute to the formation of cysteine-linked dimers. We previously reported that any one of the three cysteine residues is sufficient to produce functional BST-2 dimers. Here we investigated the importance of cysteine positioning on the ectodomain for functional dimerization of BST-2. Starting with a cysteine-free monomeric form of BST-2, individual cysteine residues were reintroduced at various locations throughout the ectodomain. The resulting BST-2 variants were tested for expression, dimerization, surface presentation, and inhibition of HIV-1 virus release. We found significant flexibility in the positioning of cysteine residues, although the propensity to form cysteine-linked dimers generally decreased with increasing distance from the N terminus. Interestingly, all BST-2 variants, including the one lacking all three ectodomain cysteines, retained the ability to form non-covalent dimers, and all of the BST-2 variants were efficiently expressed at the cell surface. Importantly, not all BST-2 variants capable of forming cysteine-linked dimers were functional, suggesting that cysteine-linked dimerization of BST-2 is necessary but not sufficient for inhibiting virus release. Our results expose new structural constraints governing the functional dimerization of BST-2, a property essential to its role as a restriction factor tethering viruses to the host cell.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate relationships between HIV-1 evolution, including immune evasion, and markers of disease progression during chronic infection.

Design
HIV-1 evolution and disease progression markers were evaluated over approximately 5 years of infection among 37 Kenyan women from a prospective, seroincident cohort. Evolution was measured in two genes, gag and env, which are primary targets of cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively.

Methods
Proviral HIV-1 gag and env sequences were obtained from early and chronic infection when plasma viral load and CD4 cell counts were available. Human leukocyte antigen types were obtained to identify changes in gag cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes. The breadth of the neutralizing antibody response was measured for each woman’s plasma against a panel of six viruses. Tests of association were performed between virus evolution (diversity, divergence, and ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence), markers of disease progression (viral load and CD4 cell count), and immune parameters (gag cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope mutation and neutralizing antibody breadth).

Results
HIV-1 gag and env diversity and divergence were highly correlated in early and late infection. Divergence in gag was strongly correlated with viral load, largely because of the accumulation of synonymous changes. Mutation in gag cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes was associated with higher viral load. There was evidence for adaptive evolution in env, but the extent of env evolution was only weakly associated with neutralizing antibody breadth.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that HIV-1 evolution in gag and env is highly correlated but exhibits gene-specific differences. The different immune pressures on these genes may partly explain differences in evolution and consequences for HIV-1 disease progression.},

Recent technological advances have greatly improved our ability to quantify minute amounts of substance from a tiny volume of biological sample. This has in turn led to a need to improve statistical methods for calibration. In this article, we focus on developing calibration methods robust to dependent outliers. We introduce a novel normal mixture model with dependent error terms to model the experimental noise. In addition, we propose a reparameterization of the five parameter logistic nonlinear regression model that allows us to better incorporate prior information. We examine the performance of our methods with simulation studies and show that they lead to a substantial increase in performance measured in terms of mean squared error of estimation and a measure of the average prediction accuracy. A real data example from the HIV Vaccine Trials Network Laboratory is used to illustrate the methods.},

	abstract = {Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), influenza virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have heavily glycosylated, highly variable surface proteins. Here we explore N-linked glycosylation site (sequon) variation at the population level in these viruses, using a new Web-based program developed to facilitate the sequon tracking and to define patterns (www.hiv.lanl.gov). This tool allowed rapid visualization of the two distinctive patterns of sequon variation found in HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV CPZ. The first pattern (fixed) describes readily aligned sites that are either simply present or absent. These sites tend to be occupied by high-mannose glycans. The second pattern (shifting) refers to sites embedded in regions of extreme local length variation and is characterized by shifts in terms of the relative position and local density of sequons; these sites tend to be populated by complex carbohydrates. HIV, with its extreme variation in number and precise location of sequons, does not have a net increase in the number of sites over time at the population level. Primate lentiviral lineages have host species-dependent levels of sequon shifting, with HIV-1 in humans the most extreme. HCV E1 and E2 proteins, despite evolving extremely rapidly through point mutation, show limited sequon variation, although two shifting sites were identified. Human influenza A hemagglutinin H3 HA1 is accumulating sequons over time, but this trend is not evident in any other avian or human influenza A serotypes.},

In the present work, we delineate the molecular recognition of chemokine receptor CCR5 by a dual tropic HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop, using a comprehensive set of computational tools predominantly based on molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We report, what is to our knowledge, the first complete HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop : CCR5 complex structure, which includes the whole V3 loop and the N-terminus of CCR5, and exhibits exceptional agreement with previous experimental findings. The computationally derived structure sheds light into the functional role of HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop and CCR5 residues associated with the HIV-1 coreceptor activity, and provides insights into the HIV-1 coreceptor selectivity and the blocking mechanism of HIV-1 gp120 by maraviroc. By comparing the binding of the specific dual tropic HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop with CCR5 and CXCR4, we observe that the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop residues 13–21, which include the tip, share nearly identical structural and energetic properties in complex with both coreceptors. This result paves the way for the design of dual CCR5/CXCR4 targeted peptides as novel potential anti-AIDS therapeutics.},

	abstract = {The gp120 envelope glycoprotein of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promotes virus entry by sequentially binding CD4 and the CCR5 chemokine receptor on the target cell. Previously, we adapted a primary HIV-1 isolate, ADA, to replicate in CD4-negative canine cells expressing human CCR5. The gp120 changes responsible for CD4-independent replication were limited to the V2 loop-V1/V2 stem. Here we show that elimination of a single glycosylation site at asparagine 197 in the V1/V2 stem is sufficient for CD4-independent gp120 binding to CCR5 and for HIV-1 entry into CD4-negative cells expressing CCR5. Deletion of the V1/V2 loops also allowed CD4-independent viral entry and gp120 binding to CCR5. The binding of the wild-type ADA gp120 to CCR5 was less dependent upon CD4 at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. In the absence of the V1/V2 loops, neither removal of the N-linked carbohydrate at asparagine 197 nor lowering of the temperature increased the CD4-independent phenotypes. A CCR5-binding conformation of gp120, achieved by CD4 interaction or by modification of temperature, glycosylation, or variable loops, was preferentially recognized by the monoclonal antibody 48d. These results suggest that the CCR5-binding region of gp120 is occluded by the V1/V2 variable loops, the position of which can be modulated by temperature, CD4 binding, or an N-linked glycan in the V1/V2 stem.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral setpoint during the disease-free interval has been strongly associated with future risk of disease progression. An awareness of the correlation between viral setpoint and HIV-1 genetic evolution over time is important in the understanding of viral dynamics and infection. We examined genetic diversity in HIV-1 CRF02\_A/G-IbNG-infected seroincident women in Dakar, Senegal; determined whether a viral setpoint kinetic pattern existed for CRF02\_A/G-IbNG during the disease-free interval; and correlated viral load level and diversity. Samples were drawn during the disease-free interval from consenting CRF02\_A/G-IbNG-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naïve female commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. Based on sequential plasma RNA values, low and high viral setpoint groups were established. Intrapatient diversity and divergence over time was determined from earlier and later time point DNA samples from each person. Most individuals followed the viral setpoint paradigm. For each 1/-/log(10) copy/ml of plasma increase in viral load, intrapatient diversity increased by 1.4\% (P = 0.028). A greater diversification rate was observed in the high viral setpoint group than in the low viral setpoint group (P = 0.01). Greater nucleotide (P = 0.015) and amino acid (P = 0.048) divergences and a greater nucleotide divergence rate (P = 0.03) were found in the high viral setpoint group. There was no difference between the groups in the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. The greater intrapatient diversity, divergence, and diversification rates observed in the high viral setpoint group supports the notion that diversity is driven by cycles of viral replication resulting in accumulated mutations. Recognizing diversity potential based on viral load levels in individuals may inform the design of vaccines and therapies.},

Specifically, the asymptotic distribution of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio statistics are derived. These results generalize the work of Moran (1971), Chant (1974), and Chernoff (1954). Some of Chant's results are shown to be incorrect. The approach used in deriving these results follows from comments made by Moran and Chant. The problem is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the problem of estimating the restricted mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution from a sample of size 1. In this representation the Gaussian random variable corresponds to the limit of the normalized score statistic and the estimate of the mean corresponds to the limit of the normalized maximum likelihood estimator. Thus the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is the same as the distribution of the projection of the Gaussian random variable onto the region of admissible values for the mean. A variety of examples is provided for which the limiting distributions of likelihood ratio statistics are mixtures of chi-squared distributions. One example is provided with a nuisance parameter on the boundary for which the asymptotic distribution is not a mixture of chi-squared distributions.},

The human phase 2B RV144 ALVAC-HIV vCP1521/AIDSVAX B/E vaccine trial, held in Thailand, resulted in an estimated 31.2\% efficacy against HIV infection. By contrast, vaccination with VAX003 (consisting of only AIDSVAX B/E) was not protective. Because protection within RV144 was observed in the absence of neutralizing antibody activity or cytotoxic T cell responses, we speculated that the specificity or qualitative differences in Fc-effector profiles of nonneutralizing antibodies may have accounted for the efficacy differences observed between the two trials. We show that the RV144 regimen elicited nonneutralizing antibodies with highly coordinated Fc-mediated effector responses through the selective induction of highly functional immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3). By contrast, VAX003 elicited monofunctional antibody responses influenced by IgG4 selection, which was promoted by repeated AIDSVAX B/E protein boosts. Moreover, only RV144 induced IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies targeting the crown of the HIV envelope V2 loop, albeit with limited coverage of breakthrough viral sequences. These data suggest that subclass selection differences associated with coordinated humoral functional responses targeting strain-specific protective V2 loop epitopes may underlie differences in vaccine efficacy observed between these two vaccine trials.},

We used knowledge of HIV-1 envelope structure to develop antigenically resurfaced glycoproteins specific for the structurally conserved site of initial CD4 receptor binding. These probes were used to identify sera with NAbs to the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) and to isolate individual B cells from such an HIV-1–infected donor. By expressing immunoglobulin genes from individual cells, we identified three monoclonal antibodies, including a pair of somatic variants that neutralized over 90\% of circulating HIV-1 isolates. Exceptionally broad HIV-1 neutralization can be achieved with individual antibodies targeted to the functionally conserved CD4bs of glycoprotein 120, an important insight for future HIV-1 vaccine design.
A human antibody achieves broad neutralization by binding the viral site of recognition for the primary host receptor, CD4.

	abstract = {Immunogenic, broadly reactive epitopes of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein could serve as important targets of the adaptive humoral immune response in natural infection and, potentially, as components of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome vaccine. However, variability in exposed epitopes and a combination of highly effective envelope-cloaking strategies have made the identification of such epitopes problematic. Here, we show that the chemokine coreceptor binding site of HIV-1 from clade A, B, C, D, F, G, and H and circulating recombinant form (CRF)01, CRF02, and CRF11, elicits high titers of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibody during natural human infection and that these antibodies bind and neutralize viruses as divergent as HIV-2 in the presence of soluble CD4 (sCD4). 178 out of 189 (94\%) HIV-1–infected patients had CD4i antibodies that neutralized sCD4-pretreated HIV-2 in titers (50\% inhibitory concentration) as high as 1:143,000. CD4i monoclonal antibodies elicited by HIV-1 infection also neutralized HIV-2 pretreated with sCD4, and polyclonal antibodies from HIV-1–infected humans competed specifically with such monoclonal antibodies for binding. In vivo, variants of HIV-1 with spontaneously exposed coreceptor binding surfaces were detected in human plasma; these viruses were neutralized directly by CD4i antibodies. Despite remarkable evolutionary diversity among primate lentiviruses, functional constraints on receptor binding create opportunities for broad humoral immune recognition, which in turn serves to constrain the viral quasispecies.},

	abstract = {Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples collected from five individuals during the period of viremia before seroconversion in primary infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequence analysis of amplified DNA from the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions indicated that the initial virus population of each acutely infected individual was completely homogeneous in sequence. No intrasample variability was found among the 44,090 nucleotides sequenced in this region of env, contrasting with the high degree of variability normally found in seropositive individuals. Paradoxically, substantial sequence variability was found in the normally high conserved gag gene (encoding p17) in most of the preseroconversion samples. The diversity of p17 sequences in samples that were homogeneous in V3 and V4 can most readily be explained by the existence of strong selection for specific env sequences either upon transmission or in the interval between exposure and seroconversion in the exposed individual. Evidence that localizes the selected region upon transmission to V3 is provided by the similarity or identity of V3 loop sequences in five individuals with epidemiologically unrelated HIV-1 infections, while regions flanking the V3 loop and the V4 hypervariable region were highly divergent. The actual V3 sequences were similar to those associated with macrophage tropism in primary isolates of HIV, irrespective of whether infection was acquired by sexual contact or parenterally through transfusion of contaminated factor VIII. Proviral DNA sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remained homogeneous in the V3 and V4 regions (and variable in p17gag) for several months after seroconversion. The persistence of HIV sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells identical to those found at primary infection in the absence of continued virus expression provides an explanation for the previously observed differences in the composition of circulating DNA and RNA populations in sequential samples from seropositive individuals.},

Moreover, the extended divergence was confined to the vaccine components of the virus (HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef) and not found in other HIV-1 proteins.

An HIV amino acid sequence is measured from each volunteer who acquires HIV, and these sequences are aligned together with the reference HIV sequence represented in the vaccine. We develop genome scanning methods to identify positions at which the amino acids in infected vaccine recipient sequences either (A) are more divergent from the reference amino acid than the amino acids in infected placebo recipient sequences or (B) have a different frequency distribution than the placebo sequences, irrespective of a reference amino acid. We consider t-test-type statistics for problem A and Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Kullback–Leibler-type statistics for problem B. The test statistics incorporate weights to reflect biological information contained in different amino acid positions and mismatches. Position-specific p-values are obtained by approximating the null distribution of the statistics either by a permutation procedure or by a nonparametric estimation. A permutation method is used to estimate a cut-off p-value to control the per comparison error rate at a prespecified level. The methods are examined in simulations and are applied to two HIV examples. The methods for problem B address the general problem of comparing discrete frequency distributions between groups in a high-dimensional data setting.},

Five groups of six rhesus macaques (RMs) each were vaccinated with DNA/EP-AdC6-AdC7, VV-AdC6-AdC7, DNA/-EP-VV-AdC6, DNA/EP-VV-AdC7, or AdHu5-AdHu5-AdHu5 and were challenged repeatedly with low-dose intrarectal SIVmac239. Upon challenge, there were no significant differences among study groups in terms of virus acquisition or viral load after infection. When taken together, the immunization regimens did not protect against SIV acquisition compared with controls but did result in an ∼ 1.6-log decline in set-point viremia. Although all immunized RMs had detectable SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in blood and rectal mucosa, we found no correlation between the number or function of these SIV-specific CD8(+) T cells and protection against SIV acquisition. Interestingly, RMs experiencing breakthrough infection showed significantly higher prechallenge levels of CD4(+)C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells in the rectal biopsies (RB) than animals that remained uninfected. In addition, among the infected RMs, the percentage of CD4(+)CCR5(+)Ki-67(+) T cells in RBs prechallenge correlated with higher early viremia. Overall, these data suggest that the levels of activated CD4(+)CCR5(+) target T cells in the rectal mucosa may predict the risk of SIV acquisition in RMs vaccinated with vectors that express SIVGag/Tat.},

Developments in sequencing technology now enable us to assay all genetic variation, much of which is extremely rare. We propose to test the distribution of rare variants we observe in cases versus controls. To do so, we present a novel application of the C-alpha statistic to test these rare variants. C-alpha aims to determine whether the set of variants observed in cases and controls is a mixture, such that some of the variants confer risk or protection or are phenotypically neutral. Risk variants are expected to be more common in cases; protective variants more common in controls. C-alpha is sensitive to this imbalance, regardless of its origin—risk, protective, or both—but is ideally suited for a mixture of protective and risk variants. Variation in APOB nicely illustrates a mixture, in that certain rare variants increase triglyceride levels while others decrease it. The hallmark feature of C-alpha is that it uses the distribution of variation observed in cases and controls to detect the presence of a mixture, thus implicating genes or pathways as risk factors for disease.},

Our approach does not require the availability of structural information for either the antibody or antigen. Predictions of the conformational epitopes of ten broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies are shown to be in good agreement with new and existing experimental data.

VRC01 partially mimics CD4 interaction with gp120. A shift from the CD4-defined orientation, however, focuses VRC01 onto the vulnerable site of initial CD4 attachment, allowing it to overcome the glycan and conformational masking that diminishes the neutralization potency of most CD4-binding-site antibodies. To achieve this recognition, VRC01 contacts gp120 mainly through immunoglobulin V-gene regions substantially altered from their genomic precursors. Partial receptor mimicry and extensive affinity maturation thus facilitate neutralization of HIV-1 by natural human antibodies.},

	abstract = {A guiding principle for HIV vaccine design has been that cellular and humoral immunity work together to provide the strongest degree of efficacy. However, three efficacy trials of Ad5-vectored HIV vaccines showed no protection. Transmission was increased in two of the trials, suggesting that this vaccine strategy elicited CD4+ T-cell responses that provide more targets for infection, attenuating protection or increasing transmission. The degree to which this problem extends to other HIV vaccine candidates is not known. Here, we show that a gp120-CD4 chimeric subunit protein vaccine (full-length single chain) elicits heterologous protection against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) acquisition in three independent rhesus macaque repeated low-dose rectal challenge studies with SHIV162P3 or SIVmac251. Protection against acquisition was observed with multiple formulations and challenges. In each study, protection correlated with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity specific for CD4-induced epitopes, provided that the concurrent antivaccine T-cell responses were minimal. Protection was lost in instances when T-cell responses were high or when the requisite antibody titers had declined. Our studies suggest that balance between a protective antibody response and antigen-specific T-cell activation is the critical element to vaccine-mediated protection against HIV. Achieving and sustaining such a balance, while enhancing antibody durability, is the major challenge for HIV vaccine development, regardless of the immunogen or vaccine formulation.},

	doi = {10.1128/JVI.01164-14},
	abstract = {The RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial demonstrated partial efficacy of 31\% against HIV-1 infection. Studies into possible correlates of protection found that antibodies specific to the V1 and V2 (V1/V2) region of envelope correlated inversely with infection risk and that viruses isolated from trial participants contained genetic signatures of vaccine-induced pressure in the V1/V2 region. We explored the hypothesis that the genetic signatures in V1 and V2 could be partly attributed to selection by vaccine-primed T cells. We performed a T-cell-based sieve analysis of breakthrough viruses in the RV144 trial and found evidence of predicted HLA binding escape that was greater in vaccine versus placebo recipients. The predicted escape depended on class I HLA A*02- and A*11-restricted epitopes in the MN strain rgp120 vaccine immunogen. Though we hypothesized that this was indicative of postacquisition selection pressure, we also found that vaccine efficacy (VE) was greater in A*02-positive (A*02(+)) participants than in A*02(-) participants (VE = 54\% versus 3\%, P = 0.05). Vaccine efficacy against viruses with a lysine residue at site 169, important to antibody binding and implicated in vaccine-induced immune pressure, was also greater in A*02(+) participants (VE = 74\% versus 15\%, P = 0.02). Additionally, a reanalysis of vaccine-induced immune responses that focused on those that were shown to correlate with infection risk suggested that the humoral responses may have differed in A*02(+) participants. These exploratory and hypothesis-generating analyses indicate there may be an association between a class I HLA allele and vaccine efficacy, highlighting the importance of considering HLA alleles and host immune genetics in HIV vaccine trials.
IMPORTANCE: The RV144 trial was the first to show efficacy against HIV-1 infection. Subsequently, much effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanisms of protection. Here, we conducted a T-cell-based sieve analysis, which compared the genetic sequences of viruses isolated from infected vaccine and placebo recipients. Though we hypothesized that the observed sieve effect indicated postacquisition T-cell selection, we also found that vaccine efficacy was greater for participants who expressed HLA A*02, an allele implicated in the sieve analysis. Though HLA alleles have been associated with disease progression and viral load in HIV-1 infection, these data are the first to suggest the association of a class I HLA allele and vaccine efficacy. While these statistical analyses do not provide mechanistic evidence of protection in RV144, they generate testable hypotheses for the HIV vaccine community and they highlight the importance of assessing the impact of host immune genetics in vaccine-induced immunity and protection.

A tier 2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb), HJ16 recognizes a new epitope in the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) region that only partially overlaps with the b12 epitope. We aimed to identify the critical binding site by resistance induction in a sensitive primary CRF02\_AG strain. In four independent dose-escalation studies, the N276D mutation was consistently the only alteration found and it was confirmed to be responsible for resistance to HJ16 by site-directed mutagenesis in envelopes (envs) of the homologous CRF02\_AG, as well as of a subtype A and a subtype C primary isolate. This mutation removes an N-linked glycosylation site. The effect of N276D was very selective, as it failed to confer resistance to a range of other entry inhibitors. Remarkably, sensitivity to the CD4bs VRC01 and VRC03 mAbs was increased in the N276D mutated viruses. These data indicate that binding of the CD4bs specific HJ16 mAb critically depends on the interaction with the N276-glycan, thus indicating that HJ16 is the first glycan dependent CD4bs-specific mAb.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
The genetic characterization of HIV-1 breakthrough infections in vaccine and placebo recipients offers new ways to assess vaccine efficacy trials. Statistical and sequence analysis methods provide opportunities to mine the mechanisms behind the effect of an HIV vaccine.

Recent findings
The release of results from two HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials, Step/HVTN-502 and RV144, led to numerous studies in the last five years, including efforts to sequence HIV-1 breakthrough infections and compare viral characteristics between the vaccine and placebo groups. Novel genetic and statistical analysis methods uncovered features that distinguished founder viruses isolated from vaccinees from those isolated from placebo recipients, and identified HIV-1 genetic targets of vaccine-induced immune responses.

Summary
Studies of HIV-1 breakthrough infections in vaccine efficacy trials can provide an independent confirmation to correlates of risk studies, as they take advantage of vaccine/placebo comparisons while correlates of risk analyses are limited to vaccine recipients. Through the identification of viral determinants impacted by vaccine-mediated host immune responses, sieve analyses can shed light on potential mechanisms of vaccine protection.},

CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have the ability to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells before new virions are produced within that cell. Therefore, a rapid and vigorous CD8+ CTL response, induced by vaccination, can, in principle, prevent disseminated infection in vaccinated individuals who are exposed to the relevant virus. There has thus been interest in novel vaccine strategies that will enhance the induction of CD8+ CTLs. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that targeting an antigen to undergo more efficient processing by the class I processing pathway will elicit a more vigorous CD8+ CTL response against that antigen. Targeting a type I transmembrane protein, the HIV-1 envelope (env) protein, for expression in the cytoplasm, rather than allowing its normal co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, sensitized target cells expressing this mutant more rapidly for lysis by an env-specific CTL clone. Additionally, a greatly enhanced de novo env-specific CTL response was induced in vivo after immunization of mice with recombinant vaccinia vectors expressing the cytoplasmic env mutant. Similarly, targeting a cytoplasmic protein, HIV-1 nef, to undergo rapid cytoplasmic degradation induced a greatly enhanced de novo nef-specific CD8+ CTL response in vivo after immunization of mice with either recombinant vaccinia vectors or DNA expression plasmids expressing the degradation targeted nef mutant. The targeting of viral antigens for rapid cytoplasmic degradation represents a novel and highly effective vaccine strategy for the induction of enhanced de novo CTL responses in vivo.},

Twelve mutations positively associated with NRTI treatment strongly correlated both in pairs and in clusters with known NRTI resistance mutations on divergent evolutionary pathways. In particular, T39A, K43E/Q, K122E, E203K, and H208Y clustered with the nucleoside analogue mutation 1 cluster (NAM1; M41L+L210W+T215Y). Their copresence in this cluster was associated with an increase in thymidine analogue resistance. Moreover, treatment failure in the presence of K43E, K122E, or H208Y was significantly associated with higher viremia and lower CD4 cell count. Differently, D218E clustered with the NAM2 pathway (D67N+K70R+K219Q+T215F), and its presence in this cluster determined an increase in zidovudine resistance. In contrast, three mutations (V35I, I50V, and R83K) negatively associated with NRTI treatment showed negative correlations with NRTI resistance mutations and were associated with increased susceptibility to specific NRTIs. In particular, I50V negatively correlated with the lamivudine-selected mutation M184V and was associated with a decrease in M184V/lamivudine resistance, whereas R83K negatively correlated with both NAM1 and NAM2 clusters and was associated with a decrease in thymidine analogue resistance. Finally, the association pattern of the F214L polymorphism revealed its propensity for the NAM2 pathway and its strong negative association with the NAM1 pathway. Our study provides evidence of novel RT mutational patterns that regulate positively and/or negatively NRTI resistance and strongly suggests that other mutations beyond those currently known to confer resistance should be considered for improved prediction of clinical response to antiretroviral drugs.},

In five HIV-1 seroconverters, the viral phenotype was found to be uniformly macrophage-tropic and non-syncytium-inducing. Furthermore, the viruses were genotypically homogeneous within each patient, but a common signature sequence was not discernible among transmitted viruses. In the two cases where the sexual partners were also studied, the sequences of the transmitted viruses matched best with minor variants in the blood of the transmitters. There was also a stronger pressure to conserve sequences in gp120 than in gp41, nef, and p17, suggesting that a selective mechanism is involved in transmission.},

The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic. The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would be a major undertaking.Principal FindingsHere, we have drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, and generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules, cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future biochemical and functional analysis.ConclusionsEncompassing all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly global analysis of immune responses supporting rational development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to provide new basic insights into HLA structure-function relationships. The method is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan.},

Many of these association tests may be correlated with one another because of linkage disequilibrium between nearby markers and correlation between traits and models. Permutation tests and simulation-based methods are often employed to adjust groups of correlated tests for multiple testing, since conventional methods such as Bonferroni correction are overly conservative when tests are correlated. We present here a method of computing P values adjusted for correlated tests (PACT) that attains the accuracy of permutation or simulation-based tests in much less computation time, and we show that our method applies to many common association tests that are based on multiple traits, markers, and genetic models. Simulation demonstrates that PACT attains the power of permutation testing and provides a valid adjustment for hundreds of correlated association tests. In data analyzed as part of the Finland–United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics (FUSION) study, we observe a near one-to-one relationship (r2{\textgreater}.999) between PACT and the corresponding permutation-based P values, achieving the same precision as permutation testing but thousands of times faster.},

Its smaller size lends it an obvious appeal to users-it provides a more significant-looking summary of the evidence against the null hypothesis. This paper examines the possibility that the user might overstate the significance of the evidence by using the smaller mid-p in place of the standard p-value. Routine use of the mid-p is shown to control a quantity related to the Type I error rate. This related quantity is appropriate to consider when the decision to accept or reject the null hypothesis is not always firm. The natural, subjective interpretation of a p-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true is also examined. The usual asymptotic correspondence between these two probabilities for one-sided hypotheses is shown to be strengthened when the standard p-value is replaced by the mid-p. /// La valeur-mi-p est la valeur-p standard pour un test moins la moitié de la différence entre la valeur-p et la valeur inférieure possible la plus proche.

In particular, these rates were discussed in connection with the neutral theory of molecular evolution. It was common to all the five pathogenic viruses that the rate of synonymous substitution was higher than that of, nonsynonymous substitution particularly when the entire gene regions were compared between different isolates. This suggests that the viral proteins are quite conservative to functional and structural changes even though most of theses viral genomes are evolving at a speed extraordinarily higher than their host genomes. Thus, this feature is consistent with the neutral theory. However, it is also pointed out that positive selection may be operating on some specific sites such as antigenic sites in order for the pathogenic viruses to escape from the host immune system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an alternative covariance estimator to the robust covariance estimator of generalized estimating equations (GEE). Hypothesis tests using the robust covariance estimator can have inflated size when the number of independent clusters is small. Resampling methods, such as the jackknife and bootstrap, have been suggested for covariance estimation when the number of clusters is small. A drawback of the resampling methods when the response is binary is that the methods can break down when the number of subjects is small due to zero or near-zero cell counts caused by resampling. We propose a bias-corrected covariance estimator that avoids this problem. In a small simulation study, we compare the bias-corrected covariance estimator to the robust and jackknife covariance estimators for binary responses for situations involving 10-40 subjects with equal and unequal cluster sizes of 16-64 observations. The bias-corrected covariance estimator gave tests with sizes close to the nominal level even when the number of subjects was 10 and cluster sizes were unequal, whereas the robust and jackknife covariance estimators gave tests with sizes that could be 2-3 times the nominal level. The methods are illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on treatment for bone loss in subjects with periodontal disease.},

	abstract = {Systematic error is present in all high-throughput screens, lowering measurement accuracy. Because screening occurs at the early stages of research projects, measurement inaccuracy leads to following up inactive features and failing to follow up active features. Current normalization methods take advantage of the fact that most primary-screen features (e.g., compounds) within each plate are inactive, which permits robust estimates of row and column systematic-error effects. Screens that contain a majority of potentially active features pose a more difficult challenge because even the most robust normalization methods will remove at least some of the biological signal. Control plates that contain the same feature in all wells can provide a solution to this problem by providing well-by-well estimates of systematic error, which can then be removed from the treatment plates. We introduce the robust control-plate regression (CPR) method, which uses this approach. CPR’s performance is compared to a high-performing primary-screen normalization method in four experiments. These data were also perturbed to simulate screens with large numbers of active features to further assess CPR’s performance. CPR performs almost as well as the best performing normalization methods with primary screens and outperforms the Z-score and equivalent methods with screens containing a large proportion of active features.},

With the increasing availability of large-scale re-sequencing data for rare variant discovery, we have developed a novel statistical method for the detection of complex trait associations with these loci, based on searching for accumulations of minor alleles within the same functional unit. We have undertaken simulations to evaluate strategies for the identification of rare variant associations in population-based genetic studies when data are available from re-sequencing discovery efforts or from commercially available GWA chips. Our results demonstrate that methods based on accumulations of rare variants discovered through re-sequencing offer substantially greater power than conventional analysis of GWA data, and thus provide an exciting opportunity for future discovery of genetic determinants of complex traits.},

He presented a definition as well as a set of criteria, which are equivalent only if the surrogate and true endpoints are binary. Freedman et al. (1992) supplemented these criteria with the so-called ‘proportion explained’. Buyse and Molenberghs (1998) proposed replacing the proportion explained by two quantities: (1) the relative effect linking the effect of treatment on both endpoints and (2) an individual-level measure of agreement between both endpoints. The latter quantity carries over when data are available on several randomized trials, while the former can be extended to be a trial-level measure of agreement between the effects of treatment of both endpoints. This approach suggests a new method for the validation of surrogate endpoints, and naturally leads to the prediction of the effect of treatment upon the true endpoint, given its observed effect upon the surrogate endpoint. These ideas are illustrated using data from two sets of multicenter trials: one comparing chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the other comparing interferon-α with placebo for patients with age-related macular degeneration.},

We find that sCD4 binds to the envelope glycoproteins of all of the HIV-1 isolates tested with affinities within a threefold range, whereas those of the HIV-2 and SIV isolates have relative affinities for sCD4 two- to eightfold lower than those of HIV-1. Treatment of infected cells with sCD4 induced the dissociation of gp120 from gp41 and increased the exposure of a cryptic gp41 epitope on all of the HIV-1 isolates. By contrast, neither dissociation of the outer envelope glycoprotein nor increased exposure of the transmembrane glycoprotein was observed when sCD4 bound to HIV-2- or SIV-infected cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with sCD4 resulted in the coprecipitation of the surface and transmembrane glycoproteins from virions of the HIV-2 and SIV isolates, whereas the surface envelope glycoprotein alone was precipitated from HIV-1. However, treatment of HIV-1-, HIV-2-, and SIV-infected cells with sCD4 did result in an increase in exposure of their V2 and V3 loops, as detected by enhanced antibody reactivity. This demonstrates that receptor binding to the outer envelope glycoprotein induces certain conformational changes which are common to all of these viruses and others which are restricted to cell line-passaged isolates of HIV-1.},

 We performed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmitted/founder (T/F) virus analysis of the VAX003 vaccine efficacy trial participants to characterize the transmission bottleneck and test for vaccine-associated reduction or enhancement of infection in this injection drug user (IDU) cohort.

Methods
 We performed single genome sequencing of plasma vRNA from 50 subjects sampled in early HIV infection. Sequences were analyzed phylogenetically, T/F viruses enumerated, and a sieve analysis performed.

Results
 Eight of 19 (42\%) placebo recipients were productively infected by more than 1 virus (range 1–5, median 1, mean 1.7). This frequency of multiple virus transmission was greater than reported for heterosexual cohorts (19\%, P = .03) but not statistically different from vaccine recipients (22.6\%, P {\textgreater} .05), where the range was 1–3, median 1, and mean 1.3 (P {\textgreater} .05 for all comparisons). An atypical sieve effect was detected in Env V2 but was not associated with reduction or enhancement of virus acquisition.

Conclusions
 The number of T/F viruses in IDUs was surprising low, with 95\% of individuals infected by only 1–3 viruses. This finding suggests that a successful vaccine or other prevention modality generally needs to protect against only one or a few viruses regardless of risk behavior. T/F analysis identified an atypical genetic sieve in the V2 region of Envelope and found no evidence for vaccine-mediated enhancement in VAX003.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAn objective of the first efficacy trial of a candidate vaccine containing recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 envelope glycoprotein 120 (rgp120) antigens was to assess correlations between antibody responses to rgp120 and the incidence of HIV-1 infection
MethodsWithin the randomized trial (for vaccinees, n=3598; for placebo recipients, n=1805), binding and neutralizing antibody responses to rgp120 were quantitated. A case-cohort design was used to study correlations between antibody levels and HIV-1 incidence
ResultsPeak antibody levels were significantly inversely correlated with HIV-1 incidence. The relative risk (RR) of infection was 0.63 (95\% confidence interval, 0.45–0.89) per log10 higher neutralization titer against HIV-1MN, and the RRs of infection for second-, third-, and fourth-quartile responses of antibody blocking of gp120 binding to soluble CD4 versus first-quartile responses (the lowest responses) were 0.35, 0.28, and 0.22, respectively
ConclusionsDespite inducing a complex, robust immune response, the vaccine was unable to reduce the incidence of HIV-1. Two interpretations of the correlative results are that the levels of antibodies (i) caused both an increased (low responders) and decreased (high responders) risk of HIV-1 acquisition or (ii) represented a correlate of susceptibility to HIV-1 but had no causal effect on susceptibility. Although the data cannot definitively discriminate between these 2 explanations, (ii) appears to be more likely},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies have demonstrated the significance of detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched membrane domains or lipid rafts, especially in regard to activation and signaling in T lymphocytes. These domains can be viewed as floating rafts composed of sphingolipids and cholesterol which sequester glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins, such as Thy-1 and CD59. CD45, a 200-kDa transmembrane phosphatase protein, is excluded from these domains. We have found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles produced by infected T-cell lines acquire the GPI-linked proteins Thy-1 and CD59, as well as the ganglioside GM1, which is known to partition preferentially into lipid rafts. In contrast, despite its high expression on the cell surface, CD45 was poorly incorporated into virus particles. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that HIV-1 proteins colocalized with Thy-1, CD59, GM1, and a lipid raft-specific fluorescent lipid, DiIC16(3), in uropods of infected Jurkat cells. CD45 did not colocalize with HIV-1 proteins and was excluded from uropods. Dot immunoassay of Triton X-100-extracted membrane fractions revealed that HIV-1 p17 matrix protein and gp41 were present in the detergent-resistant fractions and that [3H]myristic acid-labeled HIV Gag showed a nine-to-one enrichment in lipid rafts. We propose a model for the budding of HIV virions through lipid rafts whereby host cell cholesterol, sphingolipids, and GPI-linked proteins within these domains are incorporated into the viral envelope, perhaps as a result of preferential sorting of HIV Gag to lipid rafts.},

In particular, edge effects can result in an unacceptably high plate rejection rate in screening runs. In an effort to minimize these variations, the authors analyzed a number of factors that could contribute to edge effects in cell-based assays. They found that pre-incubation of newly seeded plates in ambient conditions (air at room temperature) resulted in even distribution of the cells in each well. In contrast, when newly seeded plates were placed directly in the CO2 incubator, an uneven distribution of cells occurred in wells around the plate periphery, resulting in increased edge effect. Here, the authors show that the simple, inexpensive approach of incubating newly seeded plates at room temperature before placing them in a 37° C CO2 incubator yields a significant reduction in edge effect.

	abstract = {The HIV-1 envelope (Env) mediates viral entry into host cells. To enable the direct imaging of conformational dynamics within Env, we introduced fluorophores into variable regions of the glycoprotein gp120 subunit and measured single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer within the context of native trimers on the surface of HIV-1 virions. Our observations revealed unliganded HIV-1 Env to be intrinsically dynamic, transitioning between three distinct prefusion conformations, whose relative occupancies were remodeled by receptor CD4 and antibody binding. The distinct properties of neutralization-sensitive and neutralization-resistant HIV-1 isolates support a dynamics-based mechanism of immune evasion and ligand recognition.
HIV's shape-shifting envelope protein
HIV's envelope protein (Env) coats virus particles and allows HIV to enter host cells. HIV entry is highly dynamic. Env proteins work in groups of three (called trimers), which bind to the viral receptor and co-receptor, both expressed by host cells. Viral receptor binding causes a structural rearrangement in the trimer that allows for co-receptor binding and finally, viral entry. To visualize dynamic changes in Env conformation during viral entry, Munro et al. added differently colored fluorescent tags to two different regions of individual HIV trimers. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance entry transfer revealed three distinct Env conformations before cell entry. Occupation of particular conformations depended on host receptor binding.

Thus far, however, few broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies that occur naturally have been characterized. To determine whether these antibodies are part of a larger group of related molecules, we cloned 576 new HIV antibodies from four unrelated individuals. All four individuals produced expanded clones of potent broadly neutralizing CD4-binding-site antibodies that mimic binding to CD4. Despite extensive hypermutation, the new antibodies shared a consensus sequence of 68 immunoglobulin H (IgH) chain amino acids and arise independently from two related IgH genes. Comparison of the crystal structure of one of the antibodies to the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 revealed conservation of the contacts to the HIV spike.

	abstract = {The partial efficacy reported in the RV144 HIV vaccine trial in 2009 has driven the HIV vaccine field to define correlates of risk associated with HIV-1 acquisition and connect these functionally to preventing HIV infection. Immunological correlates, mainly including CD4+ T cell responses to the HIV envelope and Fc-mediated antibody effector function, have been connected to reduced acquisition. These immunological correlates place immunological and genetic pressure on the virus. Indeed, antibodies directed at conserved regions of the V1V2 loop and antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to HIV envelope in the absence of inhibiting serum immunoglobulin A antibodies correlated with decreased HIV risk. More recently, researchers have expanded their search with nonhuman primate studies using vaccine regimens that differ from that used in RV144; these studies indicate that non-neutralizing antibodies are associated with protection from experimental lentivirus challenge as well. These immunological correlates have provided the basis for the design of a next generation of vaccine regimens to improve upon the qualitative and quantitative degree of magnitude of these immune responses on HIV acquisition.

Conformational dynamics in HIV gp120 are also important in masking conserved receptor epitopes from being detected for effective neutralization by the human immune system. Crystal structures of HIV gp120 and its complexes with receptors and antibody fragments provide high-resolution pictures of selected conformational states accessible to gp120. Here we describe systematic computational analyses of HIV gp120 plasticity in such complexes with CD4 binding fragments, CD4 mimetic proteins, and various antibody fragments. We used three computational approaches: an isotropic elastic network analysis of conformational plasticity, a full atomic normal mode analysis, and simulation of conformational transitions with our coarse-grained virtual atom molecular mechanics (VAMM) potential function. We observe collective sub-domain motions about hinge points that coordinate those motions, correlated local fluctuations at the interfacial cavity formed when gp120 binds to CD4, and concerted changes in structural elements that form at the CD4 interface during large-scale conformational transitions to the CD4-bound state from the deformed states of gp120 in certain antibody complexes.},

	abstract = {Within-host genetic sequencing from samples collected over time provides a dynamic view of how viruses evade host immunity. Immune-driven mutations might stimulate neutralization breadth by selecting antibodies adapted to cycles of immune escape that generate within-subject epitope diversity. Comprehensive identification of immune-escape mutations is experimentally and computationally challenging. With current technology, many more viral sequences can readily be obtained than can be tested for binding and neutralization, making down-selection necessary. Typically, this is done manually, by picking variants that represent different time-points and branches on a phylogenetic tree. Such strategies are likely to miss many relevant mutations and combinations of mutations, and to be redundant for other mutations. Longitudinal Antigenic Sequences and Sites from Intrahost Evolution (LASSIE) uses transmitted founder loss to identify virus “hot-spots” under putative immune selection and chooses sequences that represent recurrent mutations in selected sites. LASSIE favors earliest sequences in which mutations arise. With well-characterized longitudinal Env sequences, we confirmed selected sites were concentrated in antibody contacts and selected sequences represented diverse antigenic phenotypes. Practical applications include rapidly identifying immune targets under selective pressure within a subject, selecting minimal sets of reagents for immunological assays that characterize evolving antibody responses, and for immunogens in polyvalent “cocktail” vaccines.},

It has been suggested, but not formally shown, that APOBEC3G can also induce sublethal mutagenesis, which would maintain virus infectivity and contribute to HIV-1 variation. To test this, we developed a novel model system utilizing an HIV-1 vector and a panel of APOBEC3G-expressing cells. We observed proviruses with single APOBEC3G-mediated mutations (in the presence or absence of Vif), occurring at distinct hot spots and which could be rescued and shown to have infectivity.

	abstract = {The envelope glycoproteins (Env) of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) mediate virus binding to the cell surface receptor CD4 on target cells to initiate infection. Env is a heterodimer of a transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41) and a surface glycoprotein (gp120), and forms trimers on the surface of the viral membrane. Using cryo-electron tomography combined with three-dimensional image classification and averaging, we report the three-dimensional structures of trimeric Env displayed on native HIV-1 in the unliganded state, in complex with the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 and in a ternary complex with CD4 and the 17b antibody. By fitting the known crystal structures of the monomeric gp120 core in the b12- and CD4/17b-bound conformations into the density maps derived by electron tomography, we derive molecular models for the native HIV-1 gp120 trimer in unliganded and CD4-bound states. We demonstrate that CD4 binding results in a major reorganization of the Env trimer, causing an outward rotation and displacement of each gp120 monomer. This appears to be coupled with a rearrangement of the gp41 region along the central axis of the trimer, leading to closer contact between the viral and target cell membranes. Our findings elucidate the structure and conformational changes of trimeric HIV-1 gp120 relevant to antibody neutralization and attachment to target cells.},

CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have the ability to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells before new virions are produced within that cell. Therefore, a rapid and vigorous CD8+ CTL response, induced by vaccination, can, in principle, prevent disseminated infection in vaccinated individuals who are exposed to the relevant virus. There has thus been interest in novel vaccine strategies that will enhance the induction of CD8+ CTLs. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that targeting an antigen to undergo more efficient processing by the class I processing pathway will elicit a more vigorous CD8+ CTL response against that antigen. Targeting a type I transmembrane protein, the HIV-1 envelope (env) protein, for expression in the cytoplasm, rather than allowing its normal co-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, sensitized target cells expressing this mutant more rapidly for lysis by an env-specific CTL clone. Additionally, a greatly enhanced de novo env-specific CTL response was induced in vivo after immunization of mice with recombinant vaccinia vectors expressing the cytoplasmic env mutant. Similarly, targeting a cytoplasmic protein, HIV-1 nef, to undergo rapid cytoplasmic degradation induced a greatly enhanced de novo nef-specific CD8+ CTL response in vivo after immunization of mice with either recombinant vaccinia vectors or DNA expression plasmids expressing the degradation targeted nef mutant. The targeting of viral antigens for rapid cytoplasmic degradation represents a novel and highly effective vaccine strategy for the induction of enhanced de novo CTL responses in vivo.},

	abstract = {HIV-1 is transmitted by sexual contact across mucosal surfaces, by maternal-infant exposure, and by percutaneous inoculation. For reasons that are still incompletely understood, CCR5-tropic viruses (R5 viruses) are preferentially transmitted by all routes. Transmission is followed by an orderly appearance of viral and host markers of infection in the blood plasma. In the acute phase of infection, HIV-1 replicates exponentially and diversifies randomly, allowing for an unambiguous molecular identification of transmitted/founder virus genomes and a precise characterization of the population bottleneck to virus transmission. Sexual transmission of HIV-1 most often results in productive clinical infection arising from a single virus, highlighting the extreme bottleneck and inherent inefficiency in virus transmission. It remains to be determined if HIV-1 transmission is largely a stochastic process whereby any reasonably fit R5 virus can be transmitted or if there are features of transmitted/founder viruses that facilitate their transmission in a biologically meaningful way. Human tissue explant models of HIV-1 infection and animal models of SIV/SHIV/HIV-1 transmission, coupled with new challenge virus strains that more closely reflect transmitted/founder viruses, have the potential to elucidate fundamental mechanisms in HIV-1 transmission relevant to vaccine design and other prevention strategies., A single virus is sufficient to produce an HIV-1 infection by sexual transmission. Elucidating molecular viral-host interactions responsible for virus transmission is important for curbing the AIDS pandemic.},

A detailed analysis of the critical epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies should help to define optimal targets for vaccine design.

Various neutralizing epitope specificities were determined for the top 9 neutralizers, including clade A-, clade B-, clade C-, and clade A/C-infected donors, by using a comprehensive set of assays. In some subjects, neutralization breadth was mediated by two or more antibody specificities. Although antibodies to the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) were identified in some subjects, the subjects with the greatest neutralization breadth targeted gp120 epitopes, including the CD4 binding site, a glycan-containing quaternary epitope formed by the V2 and V3 loops, or an outer domain epitope containing a glycan at residue N332.

To address this question, we used a nonhuman primate challenge model with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We show that antibodies to the SIV envelope are necessary and sufficient to prevent infection. Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we identified a two-amino-acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental mechanism of immune escape from vaccine-elicited or naturally elicited antibodies. These analyses provide insight into the limited efficacy seen in HIV vaccine trials.},

	abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of gp120 are generated by some HIV-1-infected individuals, but little is known about the prevalence and evolution of this antibody response during the course of HIV-1 infection. We analyzed the sera of 113 HIV-1 seroconverters from three cohorts for binding to a panel of gp120 core proteins and their corresponding CD4bs knockout mutants. Among sera collected between 99 and 258 weeks post-HIV-1 infection, 88\% contained antibodies to the CD4bs and 47\% contained antibodies to resurfaced stabilized core (RSC) probes that react preferentially with broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibodies (BNCD4), such as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) VRC01 and VRC-CH31. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples from a subset of 18 subjects revealed that CD4bs antibodies to gp120 arose within the first 4 to 16 weeks of infection, while the development of RSC-reactive antibodies was more varied, occurring between 10 and 152 weeks post-HIV-1 infection. Despite the presence of these antibodies, serum neutralization mediated by RSC-reactive antibodies was detected in sera from only a few donors infected for more than 3 years. Thus, CD4bs antibodies that bind a VRC01-like epitope are often induced during HIV-1 infection, but the level and potency required to mediate serum neutralization may take years to develop. An improved understanding of the immunological factors associated with the development and maturation of neutralizing CD4bs antibodies during HIV-1 infection may provide insights into the requirements for eliciting this response by vaccination.},

When tested against monoclonal antibodies targeting different sites in gp120 and gp41, Envs expressing M424 showed significant sensitivity to anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies and modestly to sCD4 and b12.

Efficacy trials have reported that recombinant Ad5 (rAd5)-HIV vaccines were not efficacious and unexpectedly associated with excess HIV infection in vaccine recipients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is urgent and will further HIV vaccine design. By comparing human CD4 T cells specific to Ad5 and CMV, we report that natural exposure- or vaccine-induced Ad5-specific CD4 T cells are highly susceptible to HIV compared with CMV-specific CD4 T cells and selectively manifest a Th17-like proinflammatory phenotype. Our findings suggest a potential mechanism for rAd5-associated excess HIV infections in vaccine recipients and highlight that testing HIV susceptibility of vaccine-generated CD4 T cells may have utility before vaccine evaluation in human trials., Efficacy trials of adenovirus 5-vectored candidate HIV vaccines [recombinant Ad5 (rAd5)-HIV] were halted for futility due to lack of vaccine efficacy and unexpected excess HIV infections in the vaccine recipients. The potential immunologic basis for these observations is unclear. We comparatively evaluated the HIV susceptibility and phenotypes of human CD4 T cells specific to Ad5 and CMV, two viruses that have been used as HIV vaccine vectors. We show that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells, either induced by natural Ad5 exposure or expanded by rAd5 vaccination, are highly susceptible to HIV in vitro and are preferentially lost in HIV-infected individuals compared with CMV-specific CD4 T cells. Further investigation demonstrated that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells selectively display a proinflammatory Th17-like phenotype and express macrophage inflammatory protein 3α and α4β7 integrin, suggestive of gut mucosa homing potential of these cells. Analysis of HIV p24 and cytokine coexpression using flow cytometry revealed preferential infection of IL-17- and IL-2-producing, Ad5-specific CD4 T cells by HIV in vitro. Our data suggest a potential mechanism explaining the excess HIV infections in vaccine recipients after rAd5-HIV vaccination and highlight the importance of testing the HIV susceptibility of vaccine-generated, vector and insert-specific CD4 T cells in future HIV vaccine studies.},

Various statistical applications, including microarray study, infectious epidemiological studies, case–control studies with contaminated controls, clinical trials allowing “nonresponders,” genetic studies for gene mutation, and fishery applications can be formulated in this setup. Under the assumption that the log ratio of probability (density) functions from the two groups is linear in the observations, we propose a generalized score test statistic to test the mixture proportion. Under some regularity conditions, it is shown that this statistic converges to a weighted chi-squared random variable under the null hypothesis of λ= 0, where the weight depends only on the sampling fraction of both groups. The permutation method is used to provide more reliable finite sample approximation. Simulation results and two real data applications are presented.},

	abstract = {Vaccination is the most cost-effective way to reduce the considerable disease burden of seasonal influenza. Although seasonal influenza vaccines are effective, their performance in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals would benefit from improvement. Major problems related to the development and production of pandemic influenza vaccines are response time and production capacity as well as vaccine efficacy and safety. Several improvements can be envisaged. Vaccine production technologies based on embryonated chicken eggs may be replaced by cell culture techniques. Reverse genetics techniques can speed up the generation of seed viruses and new mathematical modelling methods improve vaccine strain selection. Better understanding of the correlates of immune-mediated protection may lead to new vaccine targets besides the viral haemagglutinin, like the neuraminidase and M2 proteins. In addition, the role of cell-mediated immunity could be better exploited. New adjuvants have recently been shown to increase the breadth and the duration of influenza vaccine-induced protection. Other studies have shown that influenza vaccines based on different viral vector systems may also induce broad protection. It is to be expected that these developments may lead to more universal influenza vaccines that elicit broader and longer protection, and can be produced more efficiently.},

	abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens, yet their role in HIV-1 infection is unclear. To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute HIV infection. Here we report the detection of autologous Nab as early as 52 days after detection of HIV-specific antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab resulted in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus. Escape virus contained mutations in the env gene that were unexpectedly sparse, did not map generally to known neutralization epitopes, and involved primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation. This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of HIV-1 envelope glycosylation generally, led us to postulate an evolving 'glycan shield' mechanism of neutralization escape whereby selected changes in glycan packing prevent Nab binding but not receptor binding. Direct support for this model was obtained by mutational substitution showing that Nab-selected alterations in glycosylation conferred escape from both autologous antibody and epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The evolving glycan shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to HIV-1 persistence in the face of an evolving antibody repertoire.},

In order to permit the efficient identification of vaccines with enhanced capacity for eliciting cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and to assess the overall breadth and potency of vaccine-elicited NAb reactivity, we assembled a panel of 109 molecularly cloned HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses representing a broad range of genetic and geographic diversity. Viral isolates from all major circulating genetic subtypes were included, as were viruses derived shortly after transmission and during the early and chronic stages of infection. We assembled a panel of genetically diverse HIV-1-positive (HIV-1(+)) plasma pools to assess the neutralization sensitivities of the entire virus panel. When the viruses were rank ordered according to the average sensitivity to neutralization by the HIV-1(+) plasmas, a continuum of average sensitivity was observed. Clustering analysis of the patterns of sensitivity defined four subgroups of viruses: those having very high (tier 1A), above-average (tier 1B), moderate (tier 2), or low (tier 3) sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization. We also investigated potential associations between characteristics of the viral isolates (clade, stage of infection, and source of virus) and sensitivity to NAb. In particular, higher levels of NAb activity were observed when the virus and plasma pool were matched in clade. These data provide the first systematic assessment of the overall neutralization sensitivities of a genetically and geographically diverse panel of circulating HIV-1 strains. These reference viruses can facilitate the systematic characterization of NAb responses elicited by candidate vaccine immunogens.},

	abstract = {Passive aggression for HIV
Antibodies that neutralize HIV could add to the therapeutic arsenal to prevent and treat disease. Lynch et al. have now tested one such antibody—VRC01—in HIV-infected individuals. Although little difference was observed in viral reservoir in individuals on antiretroviral therapy, plasma viremia was reduced in untreated subjects with a single infusion of VRC01, preferentially suppressing neutralization-sensitive strains. Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies could therefore aid in viral suppression in HIV-infected individuals.
Passive immunization with HIV-1–neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being considered for prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection. As therapeutic agents, mAbs could be used to suppress active virus replication, maintain suppression induced by antiretroviral therapy (ART), and/or decrease the size of the persistent virus reservoir. We assessed the impact of VRC01, a potent human mAb targeting the HIV-1 CD4 binding site, on ART-treated and untreated HIV-1–infected subjects. Among six ART-treated individuals with undetectable plasma viremia, two infusions of VRC01 did not reduce the peripheral blood cell–associated virus reservoir measured 4 weeks after the second infusion. In contrast, six of eight ART-untreated, viremic subjects infused with a single dose of VRC01 experienced a 1.1 to 1.8 log10 reduction in plasma viremia. The two subjects with minimal responses to VRC01 were found to have predominantly VRC01-resistant virus before treatment. Notably, two subjects with plasma virus load {\textless}1000 copies/ml demonstrated virus suppression to undetectable levels for over 20 days until VRC01 levels declined. Among the remaining four subjects with baseline virus loads between 3000 and 30,000 copies, viremia was only partially suppressed by mAb infusion, and we observed strong selection pressure for the outgrowth of less neutralization-sensitive viruses. In summary, a single infusion of mAb VRC01 significantly decreased plasma viremia and preferentially suppressed neutralization-sensitive virus strains. These data demonstrate the virological effect of this neutralizing antibody and highlight the need for combination strategies to maintain virus suppression.
A single infusion with broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 resulted in lowered plasma virus load in HIV-1–infected subjects.

	abstract = {The rapid onset of massive, systemic viral replication during primary HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and the immune evasion capabilities of these viruses pose fundamental problems for vaccines that depend upon initial viral replication to stimulate effector T cell expansion and differentiation. We hypothesized that vaccines designed to maintain differentiated effector memory T cell (TEM cell) responses at viral entry sites might improve efficacy by impairing viral replication at its earliest stage, and we have therefore developed SIV protein-encoding vectors based on rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV), the prototypical inducer of life-long TEM cell responses. RhCMV vectors expressing SIV Gag, Rev-Tat-Nef and Env persistently infected rhesus macaques, regardless of preexisting RhCMV immunity, and primed and maintained robust, SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ TEM cell responses (characterized by coordinate tumor necrosis factor, interferon-γ and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β expression, cytotoxic degranulation and accumulation at extralymphoid sites) in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. Compared to control rhesus macaques, these vaccinated rhesus macaques showed increased resistance to acquisition of progressive SIVmac239 infection upon repeated limiting-dose intrarectal challenge, including four macaques who controlled rectal mucosal infection without progressive systemic dissemination. These data suggest a new paradigm for AIDS vaccine development—vaccines capable of generating and maintaining HIV-specific TEM cells might decrease the incidence of HIV acquisition after sexual exposure.},

In both cases, we prove convergence in distribution of the statistics under the null hypothesis in the setting of a triangular array of rowwise independent and identically distributed random variables as well as consistency of the corresponding test against general alternatives. Therefore, a sound theoretical basis is provided for the parametric bootstrap procedure, which is applied to obtain critical values in a large-scale simulation study. Each of the tests considered in this study, when implemented via the parametric bootstrap method, maintains a nominal level of significance very closely, even for small sample sizes. The procedures are applied to four well-known data sets.},

During AHI, a viral latent pool reservoir develops, the immune system suffers irreparable damage, and the infected (often unsuspecting) host may be most contagious. It has proved very difficult to find individuals with AHI either in longitudinal cohorts of subjects at high risk for acquiring the virus or through cross-sectional screening, and the opportunity for diagnosis is generally missed during this phase. We review the technical strategies for identifying individuals with acute or incident HIV infection.

Most HIV-1 infected individuals develop neutralizing antibodies against their own virus, termed an autologous neutralizing response. It is known that this response exerts pressure on the envelope of HIV, the target of such antibodies, resulting in neutralization escape. Here we have identified the targets of these antibodies and the precise genetic basis of neutralization escape in 4 individuals infected with HIV-1 subtype C. We show that V1V2 is commonly involved in escape, and that the C3 region is also a target in some cases. The latter observation confirms this region is exposed in subtype C, unlike subtype B. We show that neutralization escape is conferred by a few amino acid mutations, some of which are outside the antibody target site. Moreover, escape from these limited specificities even within a single individual occurs via a variety of different pathways involving substitutions, indels and glycan shifts. The finding in 2 individuals that an anti-C3 response developed first, followed by an anti-V1V2 response, suggests there may be specific regions of envelope particularly vulnerable to antibody neutralization. Overall, we propose a mechanistic explanation for how HIV-1 epitopes drive sequential waves of neutralization escape in early subtype C infection.},

A candidate vaccine consisting of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subunit gp120 protein was found previously to be nonprotective in an efficacy trial (Vax004) despite strong antibody responses against the vaccine antigens. Here we assessed the magnitude and breadth of neutralizing antibody responses in Vax004.
Methods. Neutralizing antibodies were measured against highly sensitive (tier 1) and moderately sensitive (tier 2) strains of HIV-1 subtype B in 2 independent assays. Vaccine recipients were stratified by sex, race, and high versus low behavioral risk of HIV-1 acquisition.
Results. Most vaccine recipients mounted potent neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1MN and other tier 1 viruses. Occasional weak neutralizing activity was detected against tier 2 viruses. The response against tier 1 and tier 2 viruses was significantly stronger in women than in men. Race and behavioral risk of HIV-1 acquisition had no significant effect on the response. Prior vaccination had little effect on the neutralizing antibody response that arose after infection.
Conclusions. Weak overall neutralizing antibody responses against tier 2 viruses is consistent with a lack of protection in this trial. The magnitude and breadth of neutralization reported here should be useful for identifying improved vaccines.},

The trimer also consistently induced cross-reactive NAbs against more sensitive (Tier-1) viruses. Tier-2 NAbs recognized conformational epitopes that differed between animals and in some cases overlapped with those recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), whereas Tier-1 responses targeted linear V3 epitopes. A second trimer, B41 SOSIP.664, also induced a strong autologous Tier-2 NAb response in rabbits.

Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-α, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-α resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines.},

Understanding the biology of sexual transmission of HIV-1 could contribute importantly to the development of effective prevention measures. However, different routes of virus transmission (vaginal, rectal, penile or oral) and inaccessibility of tissues at or near the time of virus transmission make this goal elusive. Here, we apply single genome amplification and sequencing of plasma HIV-1 and a model of random virus evolution to a cohort of acutely infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and find that MSM are twice as likely as heterosexuals to become infected by multiple viruses as opposed to a single virus. Some MSM subjects were infected by as many as 7 to 10 or more genetically distinct viruses as a consequence of a single exposure event. We go on to molecularly clone the first full-length transmitted/founder subtype B HIV-1 virus and show that it is highly replicative in human CD4+ T-cells but not macrophages. Our study provides the first comparative, quantitative analysis of the multiplicity of HIV-1 infection in the two primary risk groups—MSM and heterosexuals—driving the global pandemic, and we discuss the implications of the findings to HIV-1 vaccine development and prevention research.},

	abstract = {Back to TopAbstract
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 amino acid sequence polymorphisms associated with expression of specific human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles suggest sites of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated selection pressure and immune escape. The associations most frequently observed are between expression of an HLA class I molecule and variation from the consensus sequence. However, a substantial number of sites have been identified in which particular HLA class I allele expression is associated with preservation of the consensus sequence. The mechanism behind this is so far unexplained. The current studies, focusing on two examples of “negatively associated” or apparently preserved epitopes, suggest an explanation for this phenomenon: negative associations can arise as a result of positive selection of an escape mutation, which is stable on transmission and therefore accumulates in the population to the point at which it defines the consensus sequence. Such negative associations may only be in evidence transiently, because the statistical power to detect them diminishes as the mutations accumulate. If an escape variant reaches fixation in the population, the epitope will be lost as a potential target to the immune system. These data help to explain how HIV is evolving at a population level. Understanding the direction of HIV evolution has important implications for vaccine development.},

	abstract = {This review describes the structure-based reverse vaccinology approach aimed at developing vaccine immunogens capable of inducing antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1. Some basic principles of protein immunochemistry are reviewed and the implications of the extensive polyspecificity of antibodies for vaccine development are underlined. Although it is natural for investigators to want to know the cause of an effective immunological intervention, the classic notion of causality is shown to have little explanatory value for a system as complex as the immune system, where any observed effect always results from many interactions between a large number of components. Causal explanations are reductive because a single factor is singled out for attention and given undue explanatory weight on its own. Other examples of the negative impact of reductionist thinking on HIV vaccine development are discussed. These include (1) the failure to distinguish between the chemical nature of antigenicity and the biological nature of immunogenicity, (2) the belief that when an HIV-1 epitope is reconstructed by rational design to better fit a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (nMab), this will produce an immunogen able to elicit Abs with the same neutralizing capacity as the Ab used as template for designing the antigen, and (3) the belief that protection against infection can be analyzed at the level of individual molecular interactions although it has meaning only at the level of an entire organism. The numerous unsuccessful strategies that have been used to design HIV-1 vaccine immunogens are described and it is suggested that the convergence of so many negative experimental results justifies the conclusion that reverse vaccinology is unlikely to lead to the development of a preventive HIV-1 vaccine. Immune correlates of protection in vaccines have not yet been identified because this will become feasible only retrospectively once an effective vaccine exists. The finding that extensive antibody affinity maturation is needed to obtain mature anti-HIV-1 Abs endowed with a broad neutralizing capacity explains why antigens designed to fit matured Mabs are not effective vaccine immunogens since these are administered to naive recipients who possess only B-cell receptors corresponding to the germline version of the matured Abs.},

Surprisingly, a recent study of injection drug users (IDUs) from St. Petersburg, Russia, also found most subjects to be acutely infected by a single virus. Here, we show by single-genome amplification and sequencing in a different IDU cohort that 60\% of IDU subjects were infected by more than one virus, including one subject who was acutely infected by at least 16 viruses. Multivariant transmission was more common in IDUs than in heterosexuals (60\% versus 19\%; odds ratio, 6.14; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 31.27; P = 0.008). These findings highlight the diversity in HIV-1 infection risks among different IDU cohorts and the challenges faced by vaccines in protecting against this mode of infection.},

The term "correlate of protection" has been used to refer to at least 3 distinct concepts, which has resulted in confusion surrounding this topic. We propose precise definitions of these different concepts of immune correlates, using the nomenclature "correlate of risk," "level 1 surrogate of protection," and "level 2 surrogate of protection." We suggest a general framework for assessing these 3 levels of immune correlates in vaccine efficacy trials. To demonstrate the proposed principles, we analyze data from a 1943 influenza vaccine field trial, supporting Weiss strain A—specific antibody titers as a level 1 surrogate of protection. Other real and simulated examples are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This article applies a simple method for settings where one has clustered data, but statistical methods are only available for independent data. We assume the statistical method provides us with a normally distributed estimate, theta, and an estimate of its variance sigma. We randomly select a data point from each cluster and apply our statistical method to this independent data. We repeat this multiple times, and use the average of the associated theta's as our estimate. An estimate of the variance is given by the average of the sigma2's minus the sample variance of the theta's. We call this procedure multiple outputation, as all "excess" data within each cluster is thrown out multiple times. Hoffman, Sen, and Weinberg (2001, Biometrika 88, 1121-1134) introduced this approach for generalized linear models when the cluster size is related to outcome. In this article, we demonstrate the broad applicability of the approach. Applications to angular data, p-values, vector parameters, Bayesian inference, genetics data, and random cluster sizes are discussed. In addition, asymptotic normality of estimates based on all possible outputations, as well as a finite number of outputations, is proven given weak conditions. Multiple outputation provides a simple and broadly applicable method for analyzing clustered data. It is especially suited to settings where methods for clustered data are impractical, but can also be applied generally as a quick and simple tool.},

This editing process may inhibit virus replication through lethal mutagenesis (hypermutation), but could also contribute to viral diversification leading to the emergence of escape forms. The HIV-1 Vif protein has the capacity to counteract APOBEC3 factors by recruiting a CUL5-based ubiquitin ligase complex that determines their proteasomal degradation. In this work, we analyzed the APOBEC3-mediated editing in proviral HIV-1 from perinatally infected children (n=93) in order to explore its association with polymorphisms of APOBEC3G and CUL5 genes (APOBEC3G H186R, APOBEC3G C40693T, and CUL5 SNP6), the Vif protein variability, and also the time to AIDS development. To calculate the level of editing, we have developed an index exploiting the properties of a region within the HIV-1 pol gene that includes the central polypurine tract (cPPT). We detected a reduced editing associated with the CUL5 SNP6 minor allele and also with certain Vif variants (mutations at sites 46, 122, and 160), although we found no evidence supporting an impact of APOBEC3 activity on disease progression. Thus, our findings suggest that APOBEC3-mediated editing of HIV-1 could be modulated by host and virus genetic characteristics in the context of pediatric infection.},

These differences coincide with previously-studied genetic features that are relevant to the biology of HIV infection, including features involved in immune recognition of the virus. The findings presented here generate testable hypotheses about the mechanism of the partial protection seen in the Thai trial, and may ultimately lead to improved vaccines.

The RV144 HIV-1 trial of the canary pox vector (ALVAC-HIV) plus the gp120 AIDSVAX B/E vaccine demonstrated an estimated efficacy of 31\%, which correlated directly with antibodies to HIV-1 envelope variable regions 1 and 2 (V1-V2). Genetic analysis of trial viruses revealed increased vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine strain at V2 residue 169. Here, we isolated four V2 monoclonal antibodies from RV144 vaccinees that recognize residue 169, neutralize laboratory-adapted HIV-1, and mediate killing of field-isolate HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Crystal structures of two of the V2 antibodies demonstrated that residue 169 can exist within divergent helical and loop conformations, which contrasted dramatically with the β strand conformation previously observed with a broadly neutralizing antibody PG9. Thus, RV144 vaccine-induced immune pressure appears to target a region that may be both sequence variable and structurally polymorphic. Variation may signal sites of HIV-1 envelope vulnerability, providing vaccine designers with new options.},

	abstract = {We have previously shown that the in vivo coordinated expression of individual alpha 4 and beta 7 integrin chains correlated with the leukemic potential displayed by cell lines derived from murine lymphoblastic T-cell lymphomas (T-LBLs) when transplanted subcutaneously into syngeneic AKR mice. In the present study, by using immunofluorescence and immunocytochemical analyses, we have confirmed that the in vivo up-regulation of the alpha 4 beta 7 heterodimeric complex is associated with the leukemic behavior of AKR T-LBLs. In addition, when compared with the parental, highly leukemic NQ22 cells, the variant cell line NQ22V exhibited a reduced leukemic potential that was invariably associated with a delayed alpha 4 beta 7 up-regulation in vivo Moreover, the leukemic cell line SJ-1, derived from a spontaneous T-LBL of the SJL strain, also displayed high levels of alpha 4 beta 7 expression with a pattern of tissue distribution similar to that of NQ22 cells from leukemic AKR animals. Of note, in most of the tissues involved by murine T-LBL dissemination, and particularly in liver, kidney, and lung, alpha 4 beta 7-positive leukemic cells were always located around strongly VCAM-1-positive vascular spaces. These findings are consistent with a possible role of alpha 4 beta 7/VCAM-1 interactions in the extravasation and, consequently, in the leukemic dissemination of murine T-LBL cells. Immunocytochemical analysis carried out in 11 human T-LBLs showed that pathological lymph nodes from all 7 cases with bone marrow infiltration at presentation carried alpha 4 beta 7-positive cells, whereas all 4 aleukemic T-LBLs were repeatedly alpha 4 beta 7 negative, also in metachronous lesions. These findings suggest that alpha 4 beta 7-positive human T-LBLs may represent a distinct clinicopathological entity. In addition, alpha 4 beta 7 expression was significantly more prevalent in younger patients ({\textless} 11 years; P = 0.02), further supporting such a hypothesis. Moreover, as in murine T-LBLs, the pattern of alpha 4 beta 7 positivity in involved lymph nodes was mainly focal, whereas nearly all neoplastic cells infiltrating bone marrow expressed this integrin, suggesting a possible role for alpha 4 beta 7 in the leukemic dissemination also of human T-LBLs.},

	abstract = {Summary We consider likelihood ratio tests (LRT) and their modifications for homogeneity in admixture models. The admixture model is a two-component mixture model, where one component is indexed by an unknown parameter while the parameter value for the other component is known. This model is widely used in genetic linkage analysis under heterogeneity in which the kernel distribution is binomial. For such models, it is long recognized that testing for homogeneity is nonstandard, and the LRT statistic does not converge to a conventional χ2 distribution. In this article, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the LRT for general admixture models and show that its limiting distribution is equivalent to the supremum of a squared Gaussian process. We also discuss the connection and comparison between LRT and alternative approaches such as modifications of LRT and score tests, including the modified LRT (Fu, Chen, and Kalbfleisch, 2006, Statistica Sinica 16, 805–823). The LRT is an omnibus test that is powerful to detect general alternative hypotheses. In contrast, alternative approaches may be slightly more powerful to detect certain type of alternatives, but much less powerful for others. Our results are illustrated by simulation studies and an application to a genetic linkage study of schizophrenia.},

These can be subdivided roughly into two categories: ‘first line defence’, consisting of the non-specific, innate immune system, and ‘adaptive immune response’, acquired over time following virus infection or vaccination. During evolution, viruses have developed numerous, and often very ingenious, strategies to counteract efficient recognition of virions or virus-infected cells by both innate and adaptive immunity. This review will focus on the different strategies that viruses use to avoid recognition by one of the components of the immune system: the complement system. Complement evasion is of particular importance for viruses, since complement activation is a crucial component of innate immunity (alternative and mannan-binding lectin activation pathway) as well as of adaptive immunity (classical, antibody-dependent complement activation).},

Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

	abstract = {A vaccine capable of stimulating protective antiviral antibody responses is needed to curtail the global AIDS epidemic caused by HIV-1. Although rarely elicited during the course of natural infection or upon conventional vaccination, the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of the HIV-1 glycoprotein of M(r) 41,000 (gp41) envelope protein subunit is the target of 3 such human broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs): 4E10, 2F5, and Z13e1. How these BNAbs bind to their lipid-embedded epitopes and mediate antiviral activity is unclear, but such information might offer important insight into a worldwide health imperative. Here, EPR and NMR techniques were used to define the manner in which these BNAbs differentially recognize viral membrane-encrypted residues configured within the L-shaped helix-hinge-helix MPER segment. Two distinct modes of antibody-mediated interference of viral infection were identified. 2F5, like 4E10, induces large conformational changes in the MPER relative to the membrane. However, although 4E10 straddles the hinge and extracts residues W672 and F673, 2F5 lifts up residues N-terminal to the hinge region, exposing L669 and W670. In contrast, Z13e1 effects little change in membrane orientation or conformation, but rather immobilizes the MPER hinge through extensive rigidifying surface contacts. Thus, BNAbs disrupt HIV-1 MPER fusogenic functions critical for virus entry into human CD4 T cells and macrophages either by preventing hinge motion or by perturbing MPER orientation. HIV-1 MPER features important for targeted vaccine design have been revealed, the implications of which extend to BNAb targets on other viral fusion proteins.},

Immune memory is a critical correlate: effector memory for short-incubation diseases and central memory for long-incubation diseases.

Implicit in comparative analyses is an underlying model of evolution, and the chosen model can significantly affect the results. In general, evolutionary models describe the probabilities of replacing one amino acid character with another over a period of time. Most widely used evolutionary models for protein sequences have been derived from curated alignments of hundreds of proteins, usually based on mammalian genomes. It is unclear to what extent these empirical models are generalizable to a very different organism, such as HIV-1–the most extensively sequenced organism in existence. We developed a maximum likelihood model fitting procedure to a collection of HIV-1 alignments sampled from different viral genes, and inferred two empirical substitution models, suitable for describing between-and within-host evolution. Our procedure pools the information from multiple sequence alignments, and provided software implementation can be run efficiently in parallel on a computer cluster. We describe how the inferred substitution models can be used to generate scoring matrices suitable for alignment and similarity searches. Our models had a consistently superior fit relative to the best existing models and to parameter-rich data-driven models when benchmarked on independent HIV-1 alignments, demonstrating evolutionary biases in amino-acid substitution that are unique to HIV, and that are not captured by the existing models. The scoring matrices derived from the models showed a marked difference from common amino-acid scoring matrices. The use of an appropriate evolutionary model recovered a known viral transmission history, whereas a poorly chosen model introduced phylogenetic error. We argue that our model derivation procedure is immediately applicable to other organisms with extensive sequence data available, such as Hepatitis C and Influenza A viruses.},

The structure of an HIV-1MN V3 peptide bound to the Fv of the broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 447-52D was solved by NMR and found to be a β hairpin. This structure of V3MN was found to have conformation and sequence similarities to β hairpins in CD8 and CCR5 ligands MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES and differed from the β hairpin of a V3IIIB peptide bound to the strain-specific murine anti-gp120IIIB antibody 0.5β. In contrast to the structure of the bound V3MN peptide, the V3IIIB peptide resembles a β hairpin in SDF-1, a CXCR4 ligand. These data suggest that the 447-52D-bound V3MN and the 0.5β-bound V3IIIB structures represent alternative V3 conformations responsible for selective interactions with CCR5 and CXCR4, respectively.},

	abstract = {Within-host genetic sequencing from samples collected over time provides a dynamic view of how viruses evade host immunity. Immune-driven mutations might stimulate neutralization breadth by selecting antibodies adapted to cycles of immune escape that generate within-subject epitope diversity. Comprehensive identification of immune-escape mutations is experimentally and computationally challenging. With current technology, many more viral sequences can readily be obtained than can be tested for binding and neutralization, making down-selection necessary. Typically, this is done manually, by picking variants that represent different time-points and branches on a phylogenetic tree. Such strategies are likely to miss many relevant mutations and combinations of mutations, and to be redundant for other mutations. Longitudinal Antigenic Sequences and Sites from Intrahost Evolution (LASSIE) uses transmitted founder loss to identify virus “hot-spots” under putative immune selection and chooses sequences that represent recurrent mutations in selected sites. LASSIE favors earliest sequences in which mutations arise. With well-characterized longitudinal Env sequences, we confirmed selected sites were concentrated in antibody contacts and selected sequences represented diverse antigenic phenotypes. Practical applications include rapidly identifying immune targets under selective pressure within a subject, selecting minimal sets of reagents for immunological assays that characterize evolving antibody responses, and for immunogens in polyvalent “cocktail” vaccines.},

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell antibody cloning methods have led to the identification of a variety of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies. We developed a computational tool (Antibody Database) to help identify critical residues on the HIV-1 envelope protein whose natural variation affects antibody activity. Our simplifying assumption was that, for a given antibody, a significant portion of the dispersion of neutralization activity across a panel of HIV-1 strains is due to the amino acid identity or glycosylation state at a small number of specific sites, each acting independently. A model of an antibody's neutralization IC50 was developed in which each site contributes a term to the logarithm of the modeled IC50. The analysis program attempts to determine the set of rules that minimizes the sum of the residuals between observed and modeled IC50 values. The predictive quality of the identified rules may be assessed in part by whether there is support for rules within individual viral clades. As a test case, we analyzed antibody 8ANC195, an anti-glycoprotein gp120 antibody of unknown specificity. The model for this antibody indicated that several glycosylation sites were critical for neutralization. We evaluated this prediction by measuring neutralization potencies of 8ANC195 against HIV-1 in vitro and in an antibody therapy experiment in humanized mice. These experiments confirmed that 8ANC195 represents a distinct class of glycan-dependent anti-HIV-1 antibody and validated the utility of computational analysis of neutralization panel data.},

HIV-1–specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass antibodies bind to distinct cellular Fc receptors. Antibodies of the same epitope specificity but of a different subclass therefore can have different antibody effector functions. The study of IgG subclass profiles between different vaccine regimens used in clinical trials with divergent efficacy outcomes can provide information on the quality of the vaccine-induced B cell response. We show that HIV-1–specific IgG3 distinguished two HIV-1 vaccine efficacy studies (RV144 and VAX003 clinical trials) and correlated with decreased risk of HIV-1 infection in a blinded follow-up case-control study with the RV144 vaccine. HIV-1–specific IgG3 responses were not long-lived, which was consistent with the waning efficacy of the RV144 vaccine. These data suggest that specific vaccine-induced HIV-1 IgG3 should be tested in future studies of immune correlates in HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials.},

We used a nonhuman primate model to define immune and genetic mechanisms of protection against mucosal infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). A plasmid DNA prime/recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) boost vaccine regimen was evaluated for its ability to protect monkeys from infection by SIVmac251 or SIVsmE660 isolates after repeat intrarectal challenges. Although this prime-boost vaccine regimen failed to protect against SIVmac251 infection, 50\% of vaccinated monkeys were protected from infection with SIVsmE660. Among SIVsmE660-infected animals, there was about a one-log reduction in peak plasma virus RNA in monkeys expressing the major histocompatibility complex class I allele Mamu-A*01, implicating cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the control of SIV replication once infection is established. Among Mamu-A*01-negative monkeys challenged with SIVsmE660, no CD8(+) T cell response or innate immune response was associated with protection against virus acquisition. However, low levels of neutralizing antibodies and an envelope-specific CD4(+) T cell response were associated with vaccine protection in these monkeys. Moreover, monkeys that expressed two TRIM5 alleles that restrict SIV replication were more likely to be protected from infection than monkeys that expressed at least one permissive TRIM5 allele. This study begins to elucidate the mechanisms of vaccine protection against immunodeficiency viruses and highlights the need to analyze these immune and genetic correlates of protection in future trials of HIV vaccine strategies.},

Antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope variable loops 1 and 2 (Env V1 and V2) correlated inversely with infection risk. We proposed that vaccine-induced immune responses against V1/V2 would have a selective effect against, or sieve, HIV-1 breakthrough viruses. A total of 936 HIV-1 genome sequences from 44 vaccine and 66 placebo recipients were examined. We show that vaccine-induced immune responses were associated with two signatures in V2 at amino acid positions 169 and 181. Vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine at position 169 was 48\% (confidence interval 18\% to 66\%; P = 0.0036), whereas vaccine efficacy against viruses mismatching the vaccine at position 181 was 78\% (confidence interval 35\% to 93\%; P = 0.0028). Residue 169 is in a cationic glycosylated region recognized by broadly neutralizing and RV144-derived antibodies. The predicted distance between the two signature sites (21 ± 7 Å) and their match/mismatch dichotomy indicate that multiple factors may be involved in the protection observed in RV144. Genetic signatures of RV144 vaccination in V2 complement the finding of an association between high V1/V2-binding antibodies and reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition, and provide evidence that vaccine-induced V2 responses plausibly had a role in the partial protection conferred by the RV144 regimen.},

	abstract = {A key step toward the discovery of a gene related to a trait is the finding of an association between the trait and one or more haplotypes. Haplotype analyses can also provide critical information regarding the function of a gene; however, when unrelated subjects are sampled, haplotypes are often ambiguous because of unknown linkage phase of the measured sites along a chromosome. A popular method of accounting for this ambiguity in case-control studies uses a likelihood that depends on haplotype frequencies, so that the haplotype frequencies can be compared between the cases and controls; however, this traditional method is limited to a binary trait (case vs. control), and it does not provide a method of testing the statistical significance of specific haplotypes. To address these limitations, we developed new methods of testing the statistical association between haplotypes and a wide variety of traits, including binary, ordinal, and quantitative traits. Our methods allow adjustment for nongenetic covariates, which may be critical when analyzing genetically complex traits. Furthermore, our methods provide several different global tests for association, as well as haplotype-specific tests, which give a meaningful advantage in attempts to understand the roles of many different haplotypes. The statistics can be computed rapidly, making it feasible to evaluate the associations between many haplotypes and a trait. To illustrate the use of our new methods, they are applied to a study of the association of haplotypes (composed of genes from the human-leukocyte-antigen complex) with humoral immune response to measles vaccination. Limited simulations are also presented to demonstrate the validity of our methods, as well as to provide guidelines on how our methods could be used.},

	abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) typically play a key role in controlling viral infections and contribute to the protective effect of many successful vaccines. In the case of HIV-1 infection, there is compelling data in experimental animal models that NAbs can prevent HIV-1 acquisition, although there is no similar data in humans and their role in controlling established infection in humans is also limited. It is clear HIV-specific NAbs drive the evolution of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein within an infected individual. The virus’s ability to evade immune selection may be the main reason HIV-1 NAbs exert limited control during infection. The extraordinary antigenic diversity of HIV-1 also presents formidable challenges to defining NAbs that could provide broad protection against diverse circulating HIV-1 strains. Several new potent monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been identified, and are beginning to yield important clues into the epitopes common to diverse HIV-1 strains. In addition, antibodies can also act in concert with effector cells to kill HIV-infected cells; this could provide another mechanism for antibody-mediated control of HIV-1 replication. Understanding the impact of antibodies on HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis is critical to helping move forward with rational HIV-1 vaccine design., HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies exert limited control during infection. However, new monoclonal antibodies have identified targets on the HIV-1 envelope vulnerable to antibody attack.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0911004107},
	abstract = {The viral spike of HIV-1 is composed of three gp120 envelope glycoproteins attached noncovalently to three gp41 transmembrane molecules. Viral entry is initiated by binding to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface, which induces large conformational changes in gp120. These changes not only provide a model for receptor-triggered entry, but affect spike sensitivity to drug- and antibody-mediated neutralization. Although some of the details of the CD4-induced conformational change have been visualized by crystal structures and cryoelectron tomograms, the critical gp41-interactive region of gp120 was missing from previous atomic-level characterizations. Here we determine the crystal structure of an HIV-1 gp120 core with intact gp41-interactive region in its CD4-bound state, compare this structure to unliganded and antibody-bound forms to identify structurally invariant and plastic components, and use ligand-oriented cryoelectron tomograms to define component mobility in the viral spike context. Newly defined gp120 elements proximal to the gp41 interface complete a 7-stranded beta-sandwich, which appeared invariant in conformation. Loop excursions emanating from the sandwich form three topologically separate--and structurally plastic--layers, topped off by the highly glycosylated gp120 outer domain. Crystal structures, cryoelectron tomograms, and interlayer chemistry were consistent with a mechanism in which the layers act as a shape-changing spacer, facilitating movement between outer domain and gp41-associated beta-sandwich and providing for conformational diversity used in immune evasion. A "layered" gp120 architecture thus allows movement among alternative glycoprotein conformations required for virus entry and immune evasion, whereas a beta-sandwich clamp maintains gp120-gp41 interaction and regulates gp41 transitions.},

Its aim is to screen a large number of diverse chemical compounds to identify candidate 'hits' rapidly and accurately. Few statistical tools are currently available, however, to detect quality hits with a high degree of confidence. We examine statistical aspects of data preprocessing and hit identification for primary screens. We focus on concerns related to positional effects of wells within plates, choice of hit threshold and the importance of minimizing false-positive and false-negative rates. We argue that replicate measurements are needed to verify assumptions of current methods and to suggest data analysis strategies when assumptions are not met. The integration of replicates with robust statistical methods in primary screens will facilitate the discovery of reliable hits, ultimately improving the sensitivity and specificity of the screening process.},

Methods. The vaccine is a mixture of 4 rAd5 vectors that express HIV‐1 subtype B Gag‐Pol fusion protein and envelope (Env) from subtypes A, B, and C. Healthy, uninfected adults were randomized to receive 1 intramuscular injection of placebo (n=6) or vaccine at dose levels of 109 (n=10), 1010 (n=10), or 1011 (n=10) particle units and were followed for 24 weeks to assess immunogenicity and safety.
Results. The vaccine was well tolerated but was associated with more reactogenicity at the highest dose. At week 4, vaccine antigen–specific T cell responses were detected in 28 (93.3\%) and 18 (60\%) of 30 vaccine recipients for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, by intracellular cytokine staining assay and in 22 (73\%) of 30 vaccine recipients by enzyme‐linked immunospot assay. Env‐specific antibody responses were detected in 15 (50\%) of 30 vaccine recipients by enzyme‐linked immunosorbant assay and in 28 (93.3\%) of 30 vaccine recipients by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. No neutralizing antibody was detected.
Conclusions. A single injection induced HIV‐1 antigen–specific CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and antibody responses in the majority of vaccine recipients. This multiclade rAd5 HIV‐1 vaccine is now being evaluated in combination with a multiclade HIV‐1 DNA plasmid vaccine.},

This relatively inefficient process results in the transmission of a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, from a diverse viral swarm in the donor, in approximately 80\% of cases. Here we compared the biological activities of 24 clade B T/F envelopes (Envs) with those from 17 chronic controls to determine whether the genetic bottleneck that occurs during transmission is linked to a particular Env phenotype. To maximize the likelihood of an intact mucosal barrier in the recipients and to enhance the sensitivity of detecting phenotypic differences, only T/F Envs from individuals infected with a single T/F variant were selected. Using pseudotyping to assess Env function in single-round infectivity assays, we compared coreceptor tropism, CCR5 utilization efficiencies, primary CD4+ T cell subset tropism, dendritic cell trans-infections, fusion kinetics, and neutralization sensitivities. T/F and chronic Envs were phenotypically equivalent in most assays; however, T/F Envs were modestly more sensitive to CD4 binding site antibodies b12 and VRC01, as well as pooled human HIV Ig. This finding was independently validated with a panel of 14 additional chronic HIV-1 Env controls. Moreover, the enhanced neutralization sensitivity was associated with more efficient binding of b12 and VRC01 to T/F Env trimers. These data suggest that there are subtle but significant structural differences between T/F and chronic clade B Envs that may have implications for HIV-1 transmission and the design of effective vaccines.},

	abstract = {Background HIV-1 co-receptor usage may play a critical role in AIDS pathogenesis. Information on viral tropism in HIV-1 seroconverters is scarce, as is the relationship with transmission of drug-resistant viruses.
Methods All consecutive HIV-1 seroconverters seen between January 1997 and December 2005 in 17 Spanish hospitals were retrospectively analysed. V3 loop amino acid sequences derived from plasma RNA at the time of initial diagnosis were used to predict co-receptor usage. Major drug resistance mutations, plasma HIV RNA, CD4 counts and HIV subtype were considered for subsequent analyses.
Results A total of 296 HIV-1 seroconverters were identified (84\% male; median age 30 years; 61\% homosexual men). Median estimated time from infection was 7 months (interquartile range, 3–11). Primary drug resistance mutations were seen in 12.5\%, being 9.5\% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), 4.4\% for non-NRTI (NNRTI) and 3\% for protease inhibitors (PI). Twenty-four (8.1\%) carried non-B subtypes. HIV tropism could be characterized in 203 seroconverters (69\%). X4 viruses (either pure or dual/mixed R5/X4) were recognized in 35 (17.2\%). There was no association between HIV tropism and mean plasma HIV RNA (4.5 versus 4.4 log copies/mL in R5 versus X4, respectively; P = 0.45) or mean CD4 counts (594 versus 554 cells/mm3, respectively; P = 0.48). The proportion of X4 viruses did not differ in patients infected with wild-type or drug-resistant viruses (17\% versus 18\%, P = 1). Intravenous drug users tended to show X4 viruses more frequently than individuals infected by sexual relationships (35.7\% versus 16.5\%, respectively; P = 0.073). After 12 months of follow-up in 78 seroconverters who did not start antiretroviral therapy, more pronounced increases in plasma HIV RNA (+5056 versus −3430) and declines in CD4 cell counts (−126 versus −60) were seen in X4 compared with R5 carriers.
Conclusions A significant proportion of recent HIV-1 seroconverters harbour X4 viruses (17.2\%), without any evidence of association between co-receptor usage, transmission of drug-resistant viruses and HIV subtype.},

HIV-1 overcomes this restriction factor by expressing HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu), which down-regulates and degrades tetherin. We report that mutations in Vpu that impair tetherin antagonism increase the susceptibility of HIV-infected cells to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and conversely that RNAi knockdown of tetherin, but not other cellular proteins down-modulated by Vpu, decreases the susceptibility of HIV-infected cells to ADCC. These results reveal that Vpu protects HIV-infected cells from ADCC as a function of its ability to counteract tetherin. By serving as link between innate and adaptive immunity, the antiviral activity of tetherin may be augmented by virus-specific antibodies, and hence much greater than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the HIV-1 envelope (Env) are key components for protection against HIV-1. However, many cross-reactive epitopes are often occluded. This study investigates the mechanisms contributing to the masking of V2i (variable loop V2 integrin) epitopes compared to the accessibility of V3 epitopes. V2i are conformation-dependent epitopes encompassing the integrin α4β7-binding motif on the V1V2 loop of HIV-1 Env gp120. The V2i monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) display extensive cross-reactivity with gp120 monomers from many subtypes but neutralize only few viruses, indicating V2i's cryptic nature. First, we asked whether CD4-induced Env conformational changes affect V2i epitopes similarly to V3. CD4 treatment of BaL and JRFL pseudoviruses increased their neutralization sensitivity to V3 MAbs but not to the V2i MAbs. Second, the contribution of N-glycans in masking V2i versus V3 epitopes was evaluated by testing the neutralization of pseudoviruses produced in the presence of a glycosidase inhibitor, kifunensine. Viruses grown in kifunensine were more sensitive to neutralization by V3 but not V2i MAbs. Finally, we evaluated the time-dependent dynamics of the V2i and V3 epitopes. Extending the time of virus-MAb interaction to 18 h before adding target cells increased virus neutralization by some V2i MAbs and all V3 MAbs tested. Consistent with this, V2i MAb binding to Env on the surface of transfected cells also increased in a time-dependent manner. Hence, V2i and V3 epitopes are highly dynamic, but distinct factors modulate the antibody accessibility of these epitopes. The study reveals the importance of the structural dynamics of V2i and V3 epitopes in determining HIV-1 neutralization by antibodies targeting these sites.
IMPORTANCE Conserved neutralizing epitopes are present in the V1V2 and V3 regions of HIV-1 Env, but these epitopes are often occluded from Abs. This study reveals that distinct mechanisms contribute to the masking of V3 epitopes and V2i epitopes in the V1V2 domain. Importantly, V3 MAbs and some V2i MAbs display greater neutralization against relatively resistant HIV-1 isolates when the MAbs interact with the virus for a prolonged period of time. Given their highly immunogenic nature, V3 and V2i epitopes are valuable targets that would augment the efficacy of HIV vaccines.},

Among the strongest signatures observed was an enrichment for the stable presence of histidine at position 12 at transmission and in early infection, and a recurrent loss of histidine at position 12 in chronic infection. This amino acid lies within the leader peptide of Envelope, a region of the protein that has been shown to influence envelope glycoprotein expression and virion infectivity. We show a strong association between a positively charged amino acid like histidine at position 12 in transmitted/founder viruses with more efficient trafficking of the nascent envelope polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and higher steady-state glycoprotein expression compared to viruses that have a non-basic position 12 residue, a substitution that was enriched among viruses sampled from chronically infected individuals. When expressed in the context of other viral proteins, transmitted envelopes with a basic amino acid position 12 were incorporated at higher density into the virus and exhibited higher infectious titers than did non-signature envelopes. These results support the potential utility of using a computational approach to examine large viral sequence data sets for functional signatures and indicate the importance of Envelope expression levels for efficient HIV transmission.},

A single virus most often establishes HIV-1 infection. As a consequence, virus sampled early in infection is usually very homogeneous. A few months into the infection, the virus begins to accumulate mutations as it evolves to evade HIV-specific immune responses mounted by the infected host. During chronic infection, the viral population diversifies, reflecting the history of mutations that arose within that infected individual. We hypothesized that particular amino acids might confer a selective advantage during transmission or early infection, and others might recur during chronic infection because they provide common and effective strategies of immune escape. We compared a large number of viral sequences from several hundred infected people sampled soon after transmission or during chronic infection to identify such infection-status “signature” patterns. A particularly robust signature was identified in the signal peptide of Envelope, a region that regulates its expression. Other signatures were found in regions of Envelope that interact with its cellular receptors, or are implicated in immune escape.},

To date, neither the functional nor the phenotypic profiles of CD8+ T cells capable of this activity are clearly understood; consequently, little is known regarding the ability of vaccine strategies to elicit them. We used multiparameter flow cytometry and viable cell sorts from phenotypically defined CD8+ T-cell subsets in combination with a highly standardized virus inhibition assay to evaluate CD8+ T-cell-mediated inhibition of viral replication. Here we show that vaccination against HIV-1 Env and Gag-Pol by DNA priming followed by recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) boosting elicited CD8+ T-cell-mediated antiviral activity against several viruses with either lab-adapted or transmitted virus envelopes. As it did for chronically infected virus controllers, this activity correlated with HIV-1-specific CD107a or macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP-1β) expression from HIV-1-specific T cells. Moreover, for vaccinees or virus controllers, purified memory CD8+ T cells from a wide range of differentiation stages were capable of significantly inhibiting virus replication. Our data define attributes of an antiviral CD8+ T-cell response that may be optimized in the search for an efficacious HIV-1 vaccine.},

	abstract = {Background
Microplate-based thrombin generation test (TGT) is widely used as clinical measure of global hemostatic potential and it becomes a useful tool for control of drug potency and quality by drug manufactures. However, the convenience of the microtiter plate technology can be deceiving: microplate assays are prone to location-based variability in different parts of the microtiter plate.

Methods
In this report, we evaluated the well-to-well consistency of the TGT variant specifically applied to the quantitative detection of the thrombogenic substances in the immune globulin product. We also studied the utility of previously described microplate layout designs in the TGT experiment.

Results
Location of the sample on the microplate (location effect) contributes to the variability of TGT measurements. Use of manual pipetting techniques and applications of the TGT to the evaluation of procoagulant enzymatic substances are especially sensitive. The effects were not sensitive to temperature or choice of microplate reader. Smallest location effects were observed with automated dispenser-based calibrated thrombogram instrument. Even for an automated instrument, the use of calibration curve resulted in up to 30\% bias in thrombogenic potency assignment.

Conclusions
Use of symmetrical version of the strip-plot layout was demonstrated to help to minimize location artifacts even under the worst-case conditions. Strip-plot layouts are required for quantitative thrombin-generation based bioassays used in the biotechnological field.},

Two live oral rotavirus vaccines, RotaTeq® (RV 5; Merck) and Rotarix® (RV 1; GlaxoSmithKline) with good efficacy against severe rotavirus disease and a reassuring safety profile could substantially impact the burden of rotavirus disease. In April 2009, WHO provided a recommendation for global introduction of these vaccines in national immunization programs of developing countries worldwide. In this article, we review published data on previous candidate rotavirus vaccines and vaccines in current use, with emphasis on their performance in developed versus developing countries. In developed countries, both first and second generation rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy against severe rotavirus disease (pooled efficacy = 73\% and 85\%, respectively). In developing countries, small early trials for the first generation vaccines failed to provide protection against rotavirus disease (pooled efficacy = 20\%), however, trials of the second generation vaccines yielded substantial improvements in efficacy in developing countries (pooled efficacy of 51\%), leading to a global recommendation for rotavirus vaccine introduction by WHO. Future efforts for these vaccines should focus on optimizing the efficacy and delivery of these vaccines in challenging target populations of Asia and Africa with the greatest burden of severe rotavirus disease.},

Here we describe the implementation of this algorithm, NEP (Neutralization-based Epitope Prediction), as a web-based server. The users must supply as input: (i) an alignment of antigen sequences of diverse viral strains; (ii) neutralization data for the antibody of interest against the same set of antigen sequences; and (iii) (optional) a structure of the unbound antigen, for enhanced prediction accuracy. The prediction results can be downloaded or viewed interactively on the antigen structure (if supplied) from the web browser using a JSmol applet. Since neutralization experiments are typically performed as one of the first steps in the characterization of an antibody to determine its breadth and potency, the NEP server can be used to predict antibody-epitope information at no additional experimental costs.

We introduce an estimand for evaluating a principal surrogate, the causal effect predictiveness (CEP) surface, which quantifies how well causal treatment effects on the biomarker predict causal treatment effects on the clinical endpoint. Although the CEP surface is not identifiable due to missing potential outcomes, it can be identified by incorporating a baseline covariate(s) that predicts the biomarker. Given case–cohort sampling of such a baseline predictor and the biomarker in a large blinded randomized clinical trial, we develop an estimated likelihood method for estimating the CEP surface. This estimation assesses the “surrogate value” of the biomarker for reliably predicting clinical treatment effects for the same or similar setting as the trial. A CEP surface plot provides a way to compare the surrogate value of multiple biomarkers. The approach is illustrated by the problem of assessing an immune response to a vaccine as a surrogate endpoint for infection.},

In this study, the effect of vif in the context of the HXB2 virus on virus replication in several CD4+ T-cell lines was investigated. vif was found to be required for replication in the CD4+ T-cell lines CEM and H9 as well as in peripheral blood T lymphocytes. vif was not required for replication in the SupT1, C8166, and Jurkat T-cell lines. The infectivity of vif-defective viruses depended on the cell type in which the virus was produced. In CEM cells, vif was required for production of virus capable of initiating infection in all cell lines studied. vif-defective virus produced by SupT1, C8166, and Jurkat cells and the monkey cell line COS-1 could initiate infection in multiple cell lines, including CEM and H9. These results suggest that vif can compensate for cellular factors required for production of infectious virus particles that are present in some cell lines such as SupT1, C8166, and Jurkat but are absent in others such as CEM and H9 as well as peripheral blood T lymphocytes. The effect of vif was not altered by deletion of the carboxyl terminus of gp41, a proposed target for vif (B. Guy, M. Geist, K. Dott, D. Spehner, M.-P. Kieny, and J.-P. Lecocq, J. Virol. 65:1325-1331, 1991). These studies demonstrate that vif enhances viral infectivity during virus production and also suggest that vif is likely to be important for natural infections.},

Previous analyses have failed to identify phenotypic properties other than chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CD4+ T-cell tropism that are preferentially associated with viral transmission. However, most of these studies were limited to examining envelope (Env) function in the context of pseudoviruses. Here, we generated infectious molecular clones of transmitted founder (TF; n = 27) and chronic control (CC; n = 14) viruses of subtypes B (n = 18) and C (n = 23) and compared their phenotypic properties in assays specifically designed to probe the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection. We found that TF virions were 1.7-fold more infectious (P = 0.049) and contained 1.9-fold more Env per particle (P = 0.048) compared with CC viruses. TF viruses were also captured by monocyte-derived dendritic cells 1.7-fold more efficiently (P = 0.035) and more readily transferred to CD4+ T cells (P = 0.025). In primary CD4+ T cells, TF and CC viruses replicated with comparable kinetics; however, when propagated in the presence of IFN-α, TF viruses replicated to higher titers than CC viruses. This difference was significant for subtype B (P = 0.000013) but not subtype C (P = 0.53) viruses, possibly reflecting demographic differences of the respective patient cohorts. Together, these data indicate that TF viruses are enriched for higher Env content, enhanced cell-free infectivity, improved dendritic cell interaction, and relative IFN-α resistance. These viral properties, which likely act in concert, should be considered in the development and testing of AIDS vaccines.},

	abstract = {Background. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) can serve as distinct, nonpolymorphic markers for evaluating diversity of expressed HIV-1. We screened for DRMs during early-acute viremia and examined the diversity in reverse transcriptase (RT) relative to envelope (env) in cases of transmitted drug resistance.
Methods. We evaluated 111 longitudinal plasma samples collected every 2–7 days from 15 individuals who seroconverted for HIV-1 infection in 1994–2000. The samples were screened with sensitive polymerase chain reaction assays for the commonly transmitted M41L and K70R mutations and for K65R, which was undetected by bulk sequencing. Mutation-positive samples were further characterized by clonal sequencing of RT and env V1–V3.
Results. Drug resistance mutations were detected in 4 of 15 seroconverters at 5–50 days of viral nucleic acid expression; most mutations disappeared about the time of seroconversion. Clonal sequencing verified low-level K65R at frequencies of 0.4\%–4.9\%. In each case, K65R coexisted unlinked with variants carrying 2–5 thymidine analog mutations at frequencies of 1.6\%–23.0\%. In one seroconverter, variants with M184V and nonnucleoside RT inhibitor mutations were also identified at first RNA expression. Each seroconverter displayed a homogeneous V1–V3 env population.
Conclusions. Reverse-transcriptase DRMs demonstrate that the breadth of variants in transmission may be greater than what is reflected in envelope sequences.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) entry into cells is mediated by a trimeric complex consisting of noncovalently associated gp120 (exterior) and gp41 (transmembrane) envelope glycoproteins. The binding of gp120 to receptors on the target cell alters the gp120-gp41 relationship and activates the membrane-fusing capacity of gp41. Interaction of gp120 with the primary receptor, CD4, results in the exposure of the gp120 third variable (V3) loop, which contributes to binding the CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors. We show here that insertions in the V3 stem or polar substitutions in a conserved hydrophobic patch near the V3 tip result in decreased gp120-gp41 association (in the unliganded state) and decreased chemokine receptor binding (in the CD4-bound state). Subunit association and syncytium-forming ability of the envelope glycoproteins from primary HIV-1 isolates were disrupted more by V3 changes than those of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. Changes in the gp120 β2, β19, β20, and β21 strands, which evidence suggests are proximal to the V3 loop in unliganded gp120, also resulted in decreased gp120-gp41 association. Thus, a gp120 element composed of the V3 loop and adjacent beta strands contributes to quaternary interactions that stabilize the unliganded trimer. CD4 binding dismantles this element, altering the gp120-gp41 relationship and rendering the hydrophobic patch in the V3 tip available for chemokine receptor binding.},

	abstract = {During HIV-1 infection, antibodies are generated against the region of the viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein that binds CD4, the primary receptor for HIV-1. Among these antibodies, VRC01 achieves broad neutralization of diverse viral strains. We determined the crystal structure of VRC01 in complex with a human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 gp120 core. VRC01 partially mimics CD4 interaction with gp120. A shift from the CD4-defined orientation, however, focuses VRC01 onto the vulnerable site of initial CD4 attachment, allowing it to overcome the glycan and conformational masking that diminishes the neutralization potency of most CD4-binding-site antibodies. To achieve this recognition, VRC01 contacts gp120 mainly through immunoglobulin V-gene regions substantially altered from their genomic precursors. Partial receptor mimicry and extensive affinity maturation thus facilitate neutralization of HIV-1 by natural human antibodies.},

	abstract = {Understanding the properties of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants capable of establishing infection is critical to the development of a vaccine against AIDS. Previous studies of men have shown that the HIV-1 env gene is homogeneous early in infection, leading to the suggestion that infection is established by a single transmitted variant. However, we report here that all of eight homosexual men evaluated beginning 3.7 to 9 weeks following onset of symptoms of acute infection harbored diverse virus populations in their blood, with median genetic distances averaging 1.08\% in the env C2V5 region and 0.81\% in the gag p17 gene. Within another 4.7 to 11 weeks, the variant lineage in env became more homogeneous, while gag sequences continued to diversify. Thus, the homogenization that has been reported to characterize acute infection is actually preceded by the replication of multiple virus variants. This early selective process focuses on viral properties within Env but not Gag p17. Hence, the viral homogeneity observed early in HIV-1 infection results from a selective process that occurs during the establishment of infection.},

This population included participants exposed to HIV through anal or vaginal receptive intercourse on multiple occasions over many years. We observed CD8+-cell noncytotoxic inhibition of HIV replication in acutely infected CD4+ cells in the vast majority of individuals most recently exposed to the virus (within 1 year). The levels of this CD8+-cell response were sufficient to inhibit the in vitro infection of the exposed subjects’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found no evidence of a significant role for CCR5 Δ32 mutation in this population, nor did CD4+ cell susceptibility to infection or HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes correlate with resistance to infection in the individuals tested. Therefore, the observed strong noncytotoxic CD8+-cell anti-HIV responses may be an antiviral immune activity contributing to the apparent protection from infection in these exposed uninfected individuals.},

A CoP as a surrogate endpoint would allow predictions of vaccine efficacy for new RV vaccines and enable a regulatory pathway, contributing to the more rapid development of new RV vaccines.

The safety and immunogenicity of a vaccine regimen consisting of a 6-plasmid HIV-1 DNA prime (envA, envB, envC, gagB, polB, nefB) boosted by a recombinant adenovirus serotype-5 (rAd5) HIV-1 with matching inserts was evaluated in HIV-seronegative participants from South Africa, United States, Latin America and the Caribbean.


Methods
480 participants were evenly randomized to receive either: DNA (4 mg IM by Biojector) at 0, 1 and 2 months, followed by rAd5 (1010 PU IM by needle/syringe) at 6 months; or placebo. Participants were monitored for reactogenicity and adverse events throughout the 12-month study. Peak and duration of HIV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated after the prime and boost.


Results
The vaccine was well tolerated and safe. T-cell responses, detected by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) ELISpot to global potential T-cell epitopes (PTEs) were observed in 70.8\% (136/192) of vaccine recipients overall, most frequently to Gag (54.7\%) and to Env (54.2\%). In U.S. vaccine recipients T-cell responses were less frequent in Ad5 sero-positive versus sero-negative vaccine recipients (62.5\% versus 85.7\% respectively, p = 0.035). The frequency of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses detected by intracellular cytokine staining were similar (41.8\% and 47.2\% respectively) and most secreted ≥2 cytokines. The vaccine induced a high frequency (83.7\%–94.6\%) of binding antibody responses to consensus Group M, and Clades A, B and C gp140 Env oligomers. Antibody responses to Gag were elicited in 46\% of vaccine recipients.


Conclusion
The vaccine regimen was well-tolerated and induced polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and multi-clade anti-Env binding antibodies.

The hypervariable regions V1 and V2 of the proviral env gene from the patients shared a homology between 97.5\% and 100\% at the time of seroconversion. To determine the in vivo diversification of these epidemiologically closely related virus strains, the patients were followed up in the early phase of HIV infection. Direct sequencing of the V1/V2 region in the env gene still revealed a very high degree of homology (96.5\%-100\%). In the case of the patient who showed the highest decrease of CD4+ cells, moderate genetic diversification of the virus was associated with a biological differentiation. The strain originally presenting two expressed substitutions displayed three more deviations 9 months after the first investigation (including one reversion to the consensus sequence). In addition, the virus that originally could not be cultivated could now be isolated as a low cytopathogenic agent. This study provides evidence that the high genetic homogeneity of HIV-1 observed at the time of seroconversion is maintained as a predominant consensus sequence in the following so-called latent phase of infection.},

	abstract = {Summary: Retroviruses are an important group of pathogens that cause a variety of diseases in humans and animals. Four human retroviruses are currently known, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1, which causes AIDS, and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, which causes cancer and inflammatory disease. For many years, there have been sporadic reports of additional human retroviral infections, particularly in cancer and other chronic diseases. Unfortunately, many of these putative viruses remain unproven and controversial, and some retrovirologists have dismissed them as merely “human rumor viruses.” Work in this field was last reviewed in depth in 1984, and since then, the molecular techniques available for identifying and characterizing retroviruses have improved enormously in sensitivity. The advent of PCR in particular has dramatically enhanced our ability to detect novel viral sequences in human tissues. However, DNA amplification techniques have also increased the potential for false-positive detection due to contamination. In addition, the presence of many families of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) within our DNA can obstruct attempts to identify and validate novel human retroviruses. Here, we aim to bring together the data on “novel” retroviral infections in humans by critically examining the evidence for those putative viruses that have been linked with disease and the likelihood that they represent genuine human infections. We provide a background to the field and a discussion of potential confounding factors along with some technical guidelines. In addition, some of the difficulties associated with obtaining formal proof of causation for common or ubiquitous agents such as HERVs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Antigenic and genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin of approximately 13,000 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from six continents during 2002-2007 revealed that there was continuous circulation in east and Southeast Asia (E-SE Asia) via a region-wide network of temporally overlapping epidemics and that epidemics in the temperate regions were seeded from this network each year. Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-SE Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution. If the trends observed during this period are an accurate representation of overall patterns of spread, then the antigenic characteristics of A (H3N2) viruses outside E-SE Asia may be forecast each year based on surveillance within E-SE Asia, with consequent improvements to vaccine strain selection.},

Characterizing the inhibitory function of CD8+ T cells during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI) can elucidate the nature of the CD8+ responses that can be rapidly elicited and that contribute to virus control. We examined the timing and HIV-1 antigen specificity of antiviral CD8+ T cells during AHI. Autologous and heterologous CD8+ T cell antiviral functions were assessed longitudinally during AHI in five donors from the CHAVI 001 cohort using a CD8+ T cell-mediated virus inhibition assay (CD8 VIA) and transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses. Potent CD8+ antiviral responses against heterologous T/F viruses appeared during AHI at the first time point sampled in each of the 5 donors (Fiebig stages 1/2 to 5). Inhibition of an autologous T/F virus was durable to 48 weeks; however, inhibition of heterologous responses declined concurrent with the resolution of viremia. HIV-1 viruses from 6 months postinfection were more resistant to CD8+-mediated virus inhibition than cognate T/F viruses, demonstrating that the virus escapes early from CD8+ T cell-mediated inhibition of virus replication. CD8+ T cell antigen-specific subsets mediated inhibition of T/F virus replication via soluble components, and these soluble responses were stimulated by peptide pools that include epitopes that were shown to drive HIV-1 escape during AHI. These data provide insights into the mechanisms of CD8-mediated virus inhibition and suggest that functional analyses will be important for determining whether similar antigen-specific virus inhibition can be induced by T cell-directed vaccine strategies.},

	abstract = {In the recently halted HIV type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine STEP trial, individuals that were seropositive for adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) showed increased rates of HIV-1 infection on vaccination with an Ad5 vaccine. We propose that this was due to activation and expansion of Ad5-specific mucosal-homing memory CD4 T cells. To test this hypothesis, Ad5 and Ad11 antibody titers were measured in 20 healthy volunteers. Dendritic cells (DCs) from these individuals were pulsed with replication defective Ad5 or Ad11 and co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes. Cytokine profiles, proliferative capacity, mucosal migration potential, and susceptibility to HIV infection of the adenovirus-stimulated memory CD4 T cells were measured. Stimulation of T cells from healthy Ad5-seropositive but Ad11-seronegative individuals with Ad5, or serologically distinct Ad11 vectors induced preferential expansion of adenovirus memory CD4 T cells expressing α4β7 integrins and CCR9, indicating a mucosal-homing phenotype. CD4 T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in response to Ad stimulation correlated with Ad5 antibody titers. However, Ad5 serostatus did not correlate with total cytokine production upon challenge with Ad5 or Ad11. Expanded Ad5 and Ad11 memory CD4 T cells showed an increase in CCR5 expression and higher susceptibility to infection by R5 tropic HIV-1. This suggests that adenoviral-based vaccination against HIV-1 in individuals with preexisting immunity against Ad5 results in preferential expansion of HIV-susceptible activated CD4 T cells that home to mucosal tissues, increases the number of virus targets, and leads to a higher susceptibility to HIV acquisition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glycans on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein (Env) play an important role in viral infection and evasion of neutralization by antibodies. In this study, all 25 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) on the HIV-1 CRF07\_BC Env, FE, were mutated individually to study the effect of their removal on viral infectivity, virion production, and antibody-mediated neutralization.
RESULTS: Removal of specific N-glycosylation sites has a significant effect on viral infectivity and antibody-mediated neutralization phenotype. Six of these glycosylation mutants located on the V1/V2 and C1/C2 domains lost infectivity. PNGS mutations located on V4/C4/V5 (except N392 on V4), were shown to increase viral infectivity. Furthermore, FE is much more dependent on specific glycans than clade B Env YU-2. On neutralization effect, PNGS mutations at N197 (C2), N301 (V3), N442 (C4) and N625 (gp41) rendered the virus more susceptible to neutralization by the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize the CD4 binding site or gp41. Generally, mutations on V4/V5 loops, C2/C3/C4 regions and gp41 reduced the neutralization sensitivity to PG16. However, mutation of N289 (C2) made the virus more sensitive to both PG9 and PG16. Furthermore, we showed that mutations at N142 (V1), N355 (C3) and N463 (V5) conferred resistance to neutralization by anti-gp41 MAbs. We used the available structural information of HIV Env and homology modeling to provide a structural basis for the observed biological effects of these mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: This report provides the first systematic experimental account of the biological role of the entire PNGS on an HIV-1 Env, which should provide valuable insights for understanding the function of Env in HIV infection cycle and for developing future anti-HIV strategies.},

	abstract = {Background   Breast milk contains anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies and other innate immune factors that inhibit rotavirus replication  in vitro . These factors could diminish the immunogenicity of oral rotavirus vaccines, particularly if breastfeeding occurs close to the time of vaccine administration.       Methods   Between April 2011 and November 2012, we conducted an open label, randomized trial to compare the immunogenicity of Rotarix (RV1) in infants whose breastfeeding was withheld one hour before through one hour after vaccination with that in infants breastfed at the time of vaccination. The trial was conducted in the peri-urban area of Ibrahim Hyderi in Karachi, Pakistan. Both groups received three doses of RV1 at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Seroconversion (anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies ≥20 U/mL in subjects seronegative at 6 weeks of age) following three vaccine doses (6, 10 and 14 weeks) was determined at 18 weeks of age (primary objective) and seroconversion following two doses (6 and 10 weeks) was determined at 14 weeks of age (secondary objective).       Results   Four hundred eligible infants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the withholding breastfeeding and immediate breastfeeding arms. Overall, 353 (88.3\%) infants completed the study according to protocol; 181 in the withholding breastfeeding group and 172 in the immediate breastfeeding group. After three RV1 doses, anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion was 28.2\% (95\% CI: 22.1; 35.1) in the withholding arm and 37.8\% (95\% CI: 30.9; 45.2) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -9.6\% [95\% CI: -19.2; 0.2] p=0.07). After two doses of RV1, seroconversion was 16.6\% (95\% CI: 11.9; 22.7) in the withholding arm and 29.1\% (95\% CI: 22.8, 36.3) in the immediate breastfeeding arm (difference: -12.5\% [95\% CI: -21.2,-3.8] p=0.005).       Conclusions   Withholding breastfeeding around the time of RV1 vaccine administration did not lead to increased anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion compared with that seen with a breastfeed at the time of vaccination. On the contrary, IgA seroconversion in infants immediately breastfed tended to be higher than in those withheld from a feeding. Our findings suggest that breastfeeding should be continued adlib around the time of rotavirus vaccination and withholding breastfeeding at that time is unlikely to improve the vaccine immunogenicity.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We derive the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistics for the simple null hypothesis that θ = θ* and of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of θ when θ = θ*. We show that there exists a reparametrization such that the MLE of the last p - 1 components of θ converges at rate Op(n-1/2). For the first component θ 1 of θ the rate of convergence depends on the order s of the first non-zero partial derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to θ 1 evaluated at θ*. When s is odd the rate of convergence of the MLE of θ 1 is Op(n-1/2s). When s is even, the rate of convergence of the MLE of {\textbar}θ 1-θ 1 *{\textbar} is Op(n-1/2s) and, moreover, the asymptotic distribution of the sign of the MLE of θ 1-θ 1 * is non-standard. When p = 1 it is determined by the sign of the sum of the residuals from the population least-squares regression of the (s + 1)th derivative of the individual contributions to the log-likelihood on their derivatives of order s. For p {\textgreater} 1, it is determined by a linear combination of the sum of residuals of a multivariate population least-squares regression involving partial and mixed derivatives of the log-likelihood of a specific order. Thus although the MLE of {\textbar}θ 1-θ 1 *{\textbar} has a uniform rate of convergence of Op(n-1/2s), the uniform convergence rate for the MLE of θ 1 in suitable shrinking neighbourhoods of θ 1 * is only Op(n-1/(2s+2)).},

	abstract = {Motivation and results: Motivated by the ability of a simple threading approach to predict MHC I—peptide binding, we developed a new and improved structure-based model for which parameters can be estimated from additional sources of data about MHC-peptide binding. In addition to the known 3D structures of a small number of MHC-peptide complexes that were used in the original threading approach, we included three other sources of information on peptide-MHC binding: (1) MHC class I sequences; (2) known binding energies for a large number of MHC-peptide complexes; and (3) an even larger binary dataset that contains information about strong binders (epitopes) and non-binders (peptides that have a low affinity for a particular MHC molecule). Our model significantly outperforms the standard threading approach in binding energy prediction. In our approach, which we call adaptive double threading, the parameters of the threading model are learnable, and both MHC and peptide sequences can be threaded onto structures of other alleles. These two properties make our model appropriate for predicting binding for alleles for which very little data (if any) is available beyond just their sequence, including prediction for alleles for which 3D structures are not available. The ability of our model to generalize beyond the MHC types for which training data is available also separates our approach from epitope prediction methods which treat MHC alleles as symbolic types, rather than biological sequences. We used the trained binding energy predictor to study viral infections in 246 HIV patients from the West Australian cohort, and over 1000 sequences in HIV clade B from Los Alamos National Laboratory database, capturing the course of HIV evolution over the last 20 years. Finally, we illustrate short-, medium-, and long-term adaptation of HIV to the human immune system.

Potencies defined by in vitro IC50 and IC80 values (50 and 80\% inhibitory concentrations) figure prominently into the selection of clinical candidates; however, much higher therapeutic levels will be required to reduce multiple logs of virus and impede escape. Here we predict bnAb potency at therapeutic levels by analysing dose–response curve slopes, and show that slope is independent of IC50/IC80 and specifically relates to bnAb epitope class. With few exceptions, CD4-binding site and V3-glycan bnAbs exhibit slopes {\textgreater}1, indicative of higher expected therapeutic effectiveness, whereas V2-glycan, gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and gp120–gp41 bnAbs exhibit less favourable slopes {\textless}1.

	abstract = {Many applied problems require a covariance matrix estimator that is not only invertible, but also well-conditioned (that is, inverting it does not amplify estimation error). For large-dimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator—the sample covariance matrix—is typically not well-conditioned and may not even be invertible. This paper introduces an estimator that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy to compute and interpret. It is the asymptotically optimal convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix with the identity matrix. Optimality is meant with respect to a quadratic loss function, asymptotically as the number of observations and the number of variables go to infinity together. Extensive Monte Carlo confirm that the asymptotic results tend to hold well in finite sample.},

The Phase III Zostavax Efficacy and Safety Trial of 1 dose of licensed zoster vaccine (ZV) (Zostavax; Merck) in 50-59 year-olds showed approximately 70\% vaccine efficacy (VE) to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ). An objective of the trial was to assess immune response biomarkers measuring antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) [by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] as correlates of protection (CoPs) against HZ.
Methods. The principal stratification ‘vaccine efficacy curve’ framework for statistically evaluating immune response biomarkers as CoPs was applied. The VE curve describes how VE against the clinical endpoint (HZ) varies across participant subgroups defined by biomarker readout measuring vaccine-induced immune response. The VE curve was estimated using several subgroup definitions.
Results. The fold rise in VZV antibody titers from pre-immunization to 6 weeks was an excellent CoP, with VE increasing sharply with fold rise [VE estimated at 0\% for the subgroup with no rise and at 90\% for the subgroup with 5.26-fold rise]. In contrast, VZV antibody titers measured 6 weeks after immunization did not predict VE, with similar estimated VE across titer subgroups.
Conclusions. The analysis illustrates the value of the VE curve framework for assessing immune response biomarkers as CoPs in vaccine efficacy trials.},

APOBEC proteins are cell-encoded factors that inhibit the replication of numerous retroviruses, such as HIV-1, and retrotransposons. In many cases, inhibition is clearly associated with cytidine-to-uridine editing of viral or transposon DNA. On the other hand, a number of studies with particular APOBEC protein/substrate combinations, or engineered proteins that are editing-deficient, have indicated that inhibitory mechanism(s) distinct from editing are also operative. Here, we have analyzed the effects of APOBEC3G, a potent HIV-1 inhibitor, on viral reverse transcription using cell-free viruses (natural endogenous reverse transcriptase assays). We report that APOBEC3G inhibits viral DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion, and does not require editing capabilities to do so. Because the addition of the first nucleotide to the tRNA primer is unaffected by A3G and the magnitude of inhibition increases as later reverse transcription intermediates are measured, we suggest that APOBEC3G acts by impeding the translocation of the reverse transcriptase enzyme along its RNA template, perhaps by binding directly to the RNA. These results provide novel insight into the biological activities of this class of host anti-viral proteins.},

Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we identified a two amino acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of HIV-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental mechanism of immune escape from vaccine- or naturally-elicited antibodies.

R5 viruses that confer efficient infection of macrophages are able to exploit low levels of CD4 for infection and predominate in brain tissue, where macrophages are a major target for infection. HIV-1 R5 founder viruses that are transmitted were reported to be non-macrophage-tropic. Here, we investigated the sensitivities of macrophage-tropic and non-macrophage-tropic R5 envelopes to neutralizing antibodies. We observed striking differences in the sensitivities of Env+ pseudovirions to soluble CD4 (sCD4) and to neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target the CD4 binding site. Macrophage-tropic R5 Envs were sensitive to sCD4, while non-macrophage-tropic Envs were significantly more resistant. In contrast, all Envs were sensitive to VRC01 regardless of tropism, while MAb b12 conferred an intermediate neutralization pattern where all the macrophage-tropic and about half of the non-macrophage-tropic Envs were sensitive. CD4, b12, and VRC01 share binding specificities on the outer domain of gp120. However, these antibodies differ in their ability to induce conformational changes on the trimeric envelope and in specificity for residues on the V1V2 loop stem and β20-21 junction that are targets for CD4 in recruiting the bridging sheet. These distinct specificities of CD4, b12, and VRC01 likely explain the observed differences in Env sensitivity to inhibition by these reagents and provide an insight into the envelope mechanisms that control macrophage tropism.

Unlike the response to many viral infections, most people do not produce antibodies capable of clearing HIV-1. Non-neutralizing antibodies that target HIV-1's envelope glycoprotein (Env) typically dominate the response, which is generated by B cells that cross-react with Env and the intestinal microbiota. Williams et al. analyzed samples from individuals who had received a vaccine containing the Env protein, including the gp41 subunit. Most of the antibodies were non-neutralizing and targeted gp41. The antibodies also reacted to intestinal microbiota, suggesting that preexisting immunity to microbial communities skews vaccineinduced immune responses toward an unproductive target.
Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aab1253.
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION Inducing protective antibodies is a key goal in HIV-1 vaccine development. In acute HIV-1 infection, the dominant initial plasma antibody response is to the gp41 subunit of the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of the virus. These antibodies derive from polyreactive B cells that cross-react with Env and intestinal microbiota (IM) and are unable to neutralize HIV-1. However, whether a similar gp41-IM cross-reactive antibody response would occur in the setting of HIV-1 Env vaccination is unknown.
RATIONALE We studied antibody responses in individuals who received a DNA prime vaccine, with a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) boost (DNA prime–rAd5 boost), a vaccine that included HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes, as well as a trivalent mixture of clade A, B, and C env gp140 genes containing both gp120 and gp41 components. This vaccine showed no efficacy. Thus, study of these vaccinees provided an opportunity to determine whether the Env-reactive antibody response in the setting of Env vaccination was dominated by gp41-reactive antibodies derived from Env-IM cross-reactive B cells.
RESULTS We found that vaccine-induced antibodies to HIV-1 Env dominantly focused on gp41 compared with gp120 by both serologic analysis and by vaccine-Env memory B cells sorted by flow cytometry (see the figure). Remarkably, the majority of HIV-1 Env-reactive memory B cells induced by the vaccine produced gp41-reactive antibodies, and the majority of gp41-targeted antibodies used restricted immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes. Functionally, none of the gp41-reactive antibodies could neutralize HIV, and the majority could not mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most of the vaccine-induced gp41-reactive antibodies cross-reacted with host and IM antigens. Two of the candidate gp41-intestinal cross-reactive antigens were bacterial RNA polymerase and pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase, which shared sequence similarities with the heptad repeat 1 region of HIV gp41. Next-generation sequencing of vaccinee B cells demonstrated a prevaccination antibody that was reactive to both IM and the vaccine–Env gp140, which demonstrated the presence of a preexisting pool of gp41-IM cross-reactive B cells from which the vaccine gp41-reactive antibody response was derived.
CONCLUSION In this study, we found that the DNA prime–rAd5 boost HIV-1 vaccine induced a gp41-reactive antibody response that was mainly non-neutralizing and derived from an IM-gp41 cross-reactive B cell pool. These findings have important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design. Because IM antigens shape the B cell repertoire from birth, our data raise the hypothesis that neonatal immunization with HIV-1 envelope may be able to imprint the B cell repertoire to respond to envelope antigenic sites that may otherwise be subdominant or disfavored, such as Env broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes. Our data also suggest that deleting or modifying amino acids in the gp41 heptad repeat 1 region of Env-containing vaccine immunogens may avoid IM-gp41 cross-reactivity. Thus, an obstacle that may need to be overcome for development of a successful HIV vaccine is diversion of potentially protective HIV-1 antibody responses by preexisting envelope-IM cross-reactive pools of B cells.

This response diverted the vaccine-stimulated antibody response away from smaller subdominant B cell pools capable of reacting with potentially protective epitopes on HIV-1 Env.
An HIV-1 DNA prime vaccine, with a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) boost, failed to protect from HIV-1 acquisition. We studied the nature of the vaccine-induced antibody (Ab) response to HIV-1 envelope (Env). HIV-1–reactive plasma Ab titers were higher to Env gp41 than to gp120, and repertoire analysis demonstrated that 93\% of HIV-1–reactive Abs from memory B cells responded to Env gp41. Vaccine-induced gp41-reactive monoclonal antibodies were non-neutralizing and frequently polyreactive with host and environmental antigens, including intestinal microbiota (IM). Next-generation sequencing of an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region repertoire before vaccination revealed an Env-IM cross-reactive Ab that was clonally related to a subsequent vaccine-induced gp41-reactive Ab. Thus, HIV-1 Env DNA-rAd5 vaccine induced a dominant IM-polyreactive, non-neutralizing gp41-reactive Ab repertoire response that was associated with no vaccine efficacy.},
