# Summary of Main Results

Summarize the main highlights from the Results section. 
This can be in bullet format. 
Any significant results mentioned should include p-values and references to 
appropriate figures and tables. 
There should be no information in the Summary section that is not contained in 
the Results section (see `r insert_ref("results", "Results")`).

# Background

<!-- The portion of the background section that is common across assays should be 
saved as a child R Markdown file in the docs/ folder so that the same text can 
be used across PT reports for the protocol. -->

```{r background, child=rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file("docs", "background.Rmd") }
```

<!-- Also include the study schema here. -->

```{r}
source(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file("R", "study_schema.R"), local = TRUE)
flextable(schema_table) %>%
  add_caption_and_label("[CAVD PI and number] study schema", "study-schema")
```

Describe this report - "This report presents [blinded/unblinded] [list assay] data 
in [list groups, including descriptions] at [list timepoints and corresponding 
relationship to vaccination, e.g., week 0 (1st vaccination), week 10 (2 weeks 
post-2nd vaccination), and week 26 (2 weeks post-3rd (final) vaccination)] as of 
[ldo_processing_date]." Note that LDO processing date comes from qdata and pdata. 
Anything special about the report could also be mentioned here (e.g., This PT report 
presents neutralization data to Tier 1A and Tier 2 versions of the vaccine strain, 
assessed by the TZM-bl assay. Additionally this report summarizes epitope mapping 
isolate pairs.")

Reference test [@Huang:2013fl].

<!-- Frequently used citations are included in the `docs/bibliography.bib` file created with `VISCtemplates::create_visc_project()`. If `docs/bibliography.bib` doesn't exist, it will be created when you knit this document. -->

## Report Amendments 

If previous reports were provided, note if this report supplements or supersedes 
the previous reports. 
For example, "the previous PT report (distributed on DDMonthYYYY) presented 
peak data. This report summarizes additional durability data."

If this is an updated report, also briefly describe additional data included 
and/or analysis done since the previous report (e.g., additional visits, 
participants (include pubIDs), antigens, comparisons, new/changed tables, figures).

# Objectives

List primary and secondary (if applicable) objectives. 
Objectives can be found on ATLAS, in the study protocol, or in the SAP.

<!-- Use `VISCtemplates::use_visc_methods()` to create child Rmd files if needed. -->

# Biological Endpoints

```

# Participant Cohort

The study enrolled [describe the total number enrolled to date and, if unblinded, 
the number in each treatment arm]. 
Include a table with data availability by key variables and red highlights for 
counts that are less than expected. 
Refer to the table and comment on reasons for missing data if known.

# Results

The results section addresses how each endpoint supports the main objectives. 
Include summary statistics and significant results as applicable, 
including p-values and table and figure references. 
The results section should provide supporting evidence for all statements made 
in the summary section.

## Section 1

Consider breaking up the results section by objective or by statistical endpoint.

## Section 2

Make sure to include p-values and references to relevant tables and figures. 
See Figure `r insert_ref("fig:example-plot")` and Table `r insert_ref("tab:example-tab")`.
