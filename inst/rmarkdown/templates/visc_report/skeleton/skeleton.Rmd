# Summary of Main Results

Summarize the findings of the report. Include specific comparisons and references to corresponding figures and tables.

# Background

Outline the study schema/schedule, study groups, time points, etc. Background information can be found on ATLAS or in the study protocol, and the background section is also included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and QC report.

Add Study Schedule Table and Specimen Schedule Table in this section

# Objectives

List primary and secondary (if applicable) objectives. Objectives can be found on ATLAS, in the study protocol, or in the SAP, and should be adjusted if necessary to accommodate available data.

# Endpoints

## Biological endpoints

Describe the lab measures of interest and the antigens/isolates tested. Information for this section can be found in the SAP, but the tense should be changed from future tense to past tense for PT reports. Most citations used are included in the bibliography.bib file populated with this template. Testing Reference: @Huang:2013fl.

## Statistical endpoints

Describe the statistical measures of interest (response, response magnitude, etc.) including response call methodology and truncation, if applicable. Assay-specific statistical endpoint information can be found at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs.

# Lab Methods

Describe the lab methods and sample inclusion criteria. Assay-specific information can be found on Github at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs/tree/master/Lab_Methods. This section may also be already included in the SAP, but verbs should be changed from future to past tense.

# Statistical Methods

## Graphical analysis

Update the following section as appropriate for your data.

Response rates were plotted, with accompanying Wilson score confidence intervals, for each group, antigen, and study time point. Distributions of response magnitude were plotted on the log scale for each group, antigen, and study time point with box plots superimposed on the distribution of responders. The mid-line of the box denotes the median and the ends of the box denote the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles. The whiskers denote the most extreme data points that were no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (i.e., height of the box). To show response trend over time, line plots of response magnitude were plotted on the log scale by study group and antigen across time points.

## Statistical tests

Update the following section as appropriate for your data. Assay-specific testing inclusion criteria can be found at https://github.fhcrc.org/VIDD-VISC/Assay_Data_Specs.  

To assess if two groups have different response rates, pairwise group comparisons were conducted using Fisherâ€™s exact test for each time point and antigen. For comparisons across time, McNemar's test were used to account for paired data. Response magnitude comparisons between experimental groups were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test among responders only. Response magnitude comparisons between time points were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to account for paired data. To be included in the time point comparisons, a participant must be a responder in at least one of the time points. 

```{r response-testing, warning=FALSE}

# example of using VISCfunctions::pairwise_test_bin for analysis
response_results <- ICS_adata %>% 
  group_by(Stim, Visit) %>%
  group_modify(
      ~pairwise_test_bin(
        x = .$response, group = .$Group, method = 'barnard', 
        alternative = 'less', num_needed_for_test = 3, digits = 1,
        latex_output = TRUE, verbose = FALSE
        )
    ) %>%  
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    ResponseTest = pretty_pvalues(
      ResponseTest, output_type = output_type, sig_alpha = .1, 
      background = 'yellow',
      bold = if_else(pandoc_markup , TRUE, FALSE),
      italic = if_else(pandoc_markup , TRUE, FALSE)
      )
    )
```

The Wilcoxon tests are rank-based tests used to account for non-normality in the magnitude measurements. Because response magnitude comparisons were performed on responders only, each group must have at least 3 responders for the comparison to be conducted. 

```{r magnitude-testing, warning=FALSE}

# example of using VISCfunctions::pairwise_test_cont for analysis
magnitude_results <- ICS_adata %>%
  group_by(Stim, Visit, Population) %>%
  group_modify(
    ~pairwise_test_cont(
      x = .$PercentCellNet, group = .$Group, method = 'wilcox', paired = FALSE, 
      alternative = 'greater', num_needed_for_test = 3, digits = 3, 
      verbose = FALSE
      )
    ) %>% 
   ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    MagnitudeTest = pretty_pvalues(
      MagnitudeTest, output_type = output_type, sig_alpha = .1,
      background = 'yellow',
      bold = if_else(pandoc_markup , TRUE, FALSE),
      italic = if_else(pandoc_markup , TRUE, FALSE)
      )
    ) %>% 
  rename("Median (Range)" = Median_Min_Max, 'Mean (SD)' = Mean_SD)
```

# Participant Cohort

Summarize the data by antigen/isolate, time point, and study group. Discuss expected vs. observed sample size. Consider including a summary table.

# Results

Summarize the statistical analyses performed.

## Section 1

Consider breaking up the results section by objective or by statistical endpoint.

## Section 2

Make sure to include p-values and references to relevant tables and figures. See Figure `r visc_ref('fig:example-plot')` and Table `r visc_ref('tab:example-tab')`.
